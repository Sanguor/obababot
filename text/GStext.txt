Ages ago, or so the stories
tell, the power of Alchemy
ruled over the world of
Weyard.
-
-
--
Alchemy wrought the base
elements of humanity
into thriving civilizations,
like lead into gold.
-
-
--
But in time, man's dreams
gave birth to untold strife.
Dreams of endless riches,
of eternal life, of dominion
over all that lived... Dreams
of conquest and of war.
-
--
These dreams would have
torn the world apart if not
for a few brave and wise
men, who sealed away the
power of Alchemy deep in
Mt. Aleph's Sol Sanctum.
-
--
-
-
Prologue from Book One
-
-
-
-
--
The town of Vale guarded
the secret for many years,
until {17}{1} and {17}{6},
whose parents died in a
storm 3 years before,
disturbed the sanctum.
-
--
Saturos and Menardi, of the
Mars Clan, followed them
into the sanctum. With them
traveled {17}{6}'s brother,
{17}{5}, thought lost
in that same tragic storm.
-
--
Saturos and Menardi stole
the Elemental Stars, the
keys to breaking the seal
on the power of Alchemy,
and kidnapped {17}{6}
and the scholar Kraden.
-
--
If these four jewels were
used to fire the elemental
lighthouses, the seal on
Alchemy would be broken.
-
-
-
--
-
{17}{1} and {17}{2} set out
to stop Saturos, rescue
their friends, and return
the Elemental Stars to
their home in Sol Sanctum.
-
-
--
They banded together with
a young Wind Adept named
{17}{3} and pursued Saturos
and Menardi to Imil, a
winter-locked town near
Mercury Lighthouse.
-
--
There, they met the guardian
of the lighthouse, a Water
Adept named {17}{4}. With
her, they pursued Saturos
to the aerie high atop
Mercury Lighthouse.
-
--
{17}{1} was too late to
stop Saturos from lighting
the beacon and escaping.
Again {17}{1} chased him,
crossing Angara to the
shores of the Karagol Sea.
-
--
Taking passage on a troubled
ship, {17}{1} crossed
the Karagol to Tolbi. He
spoke with Tolbi's leader,
a strange man named Babi.
-
-
--
Babi entered {17}{1} in
Colosso as a test of his
powers. {17}{1}'s Psynergy
won Colosso and earned him
Babi's trust. Babi revealed
a great secret to {17}{1}...
-
--
Thanks to a mystic draught
from the lost land of
Lemuria, Babi had lived
for 150 years! He offered
to help {17}{1}, who then
headed deep into Gondowan.
-
--
In the town of Lalivero,
{17}{1} learned that
Saturos and Menardi had
kidnapped a young girl
named {17}{7}, whom they
needed within the lighthouse.
-
--
{17}{1} fought and defeated
them atop the lighthouse,
but he was too late{176}the
beacon had been lit.
-
-
--
A great cataclysm followed.
{17}{7} fell into the sea.
{17}{5} jumped in to save
her, but both were lost in
the roiling waves. {17}{6}
left the lighthouse to find
them, but to no avail...
-
--
{17}{1} went to Lalivero,
where Babi asked him to find
Lemuria and the remaining
lighthouses. He gave {17}{1}
a Lemurian ship to make the
journey for the lost land.
-
--
This chapter of our story
begins with {17}{6}, just
before the beacon on
Venus Lighthouse is lit...

It doesn't seem to be{3}within your budget...{1}
It will be my pleasure{3}to fix your {20}{1}.{1}
The repairs to your{3}{20}{1} are{3}complete. Here!{1}
Do you need anything{3}else repaired?{30}

To whom should I give{3}this {20}{1}?{30}
Oh! You don't need it?{1}
Welcome! We have just{3}the gear you need.{30}
I'm sorry, but that's{3}a litle out of your{3}price range.{1}
Now, who is this for?{30}
{18}{1}'s hands are{3}full, so who wants it?{30}
{18}{1} can't equip{3}this. Is that OK?{30}
How many do you need?{30}
OK, here you go.{1}
Will you be equipping this{3}right now, {18}{1}?{30}
It suits you very well.{1}
Feel free to take a{3}look around.{30}
Thank you very much.{3}Please come again.{2}
{18}{1} can't hold{3}this {20}{1}, so{3}who wants it?{30}
What would you like?{30}
Is there anything else?{30}
What do you want to sell?{30}
Is there anything else?{30}
This {20}{1} won't{3}come off. Come back after{3}you remove it.{1}
I'm sorry, but we don't{3}carry this product.{1}
How many can you sell me?{30}
Is {22} coin{25} for{3}your {20}{1} good?{30}
What rare stuff! How{3}does {22} coin{25} sound?{30}
That comes to {22} coin{25}.{3}Does that sound good?{30}
Your {20}{1}{3}is damaged,{1}so how about{3}{22} coin{25}? {30}
How about {22} coin{25}{3}for this {20}{1}?{30}
Good, here's your{3}money.{1}
The price doesn't suit{3}you? I'm afraid I{3}can't negotiate.{1}
Please accept this money.{1}
That's my best offer.{3}Take it or leave it.{1}
We don't have many{3}rarities right now, but{3}do come again.{2}
Rarities, huh? Well,{3}here's my best stuff.{1}What would you like?{30}
I see.{1}What can I repair for{3}you?{30}
Oh, {20}{2}? I'm{3}sorry, but we don't{3}handle those.{1}
Oh, this {20}{1} is{3}in mint condition.{1}
I cannot repair your{3}{20}{1} if you can't{1}remove it.{1}
You don't have enough?{3}That's too bad.{1}
It's {22} coin{25} to repair{3}this {20}{1}, OK?{30}
You don't like the price?{3}Sorry, I don't haggle.{1}

Hmm, you were downed{3}in battle and need{3}reviving, do you?{1}
Fear not, none of your{3}companions is down.{2}

You wish me to drive{3}evil spirits away?{1}

A donation of {22}{3}coin{25} is needed to drive{3}spirits from {18}{1}.{1}Shall I begin?{30}
You cannot cover the{3}required donation, so I{3}cannot aid you.{2}

Right when I saw those{3}materials, I had to work!{1}
Which item needs my{3}special attention?{30}
Aren't you the ones{3}mucking about earlier?{2}
No, that's no good.{3}It just has no soul...{1}
It's OK if I work with{3}your {20}{1}?{30}
You want it to{3}shine, don't you?{30}
Hm... That's not right...{1}
Well, hm... I wonder{3}which one...{1}
Well, all right! I'm going to{3}make you something great!{2}
A little elbow grease, and{3}I'll make something great!{2}
Ah, so you're looking for{3}a really unique item, huh?{30}
Hey, if it ain't a'rainin',{3}I ain't a'workin'! Come{3}back when it's raining!{2}
Listen up... It's a bright,{3}sunshiny day, and I'm{3}not working till it rains.{1}But I'm not just slacking{3}because it's a nice day.{3}I only work in the rain!{2}
You want me to make you{3}a little something special?{30}
Well, look at that! You went{3}to get some raw materials{3}for me, didn't you?{2}
Hm... Maybe I made a{3}mistake. It's hard to tell...{1}If you want good work,{3}I'll need good materials.{2}
I can't wait to see what{3}I'm going to wind up{3}making with this...{1}It's funny, but I never{3}know until I actually{3}start working!{2}
My wife has the item{3}I made you. She can{3}give it to you.{2}
This? This is the blacksmith{3}Sunshine's smithy, the best{3}forge in Weyard!{1}But Sunshine's not taking{3}any jobs right now.{2}
It takes our Sunshine a long{3}time to finish the items he{3}works on.{1}Maybe you could just...wait{3}a little while before coming{3}to pick it up...{2}
Here's the item you wanted.{3}Now, about the payment...{1}We only take cash. Is that{3}all right with you?{30}
Hey, we're not a charity!{3}If you can't pay for it,{3}you don't get it!{2}
Whoops! Looks like you've{3}got a full load there!{3}This'll have to wait.{2}
You don't enough money!{3}What are you trying to{3}pull? I can't give you this!{2}
OK, here you go!{2}
Man, Sunshine would be{3}rich if he worked more.{3}What a waste...{2}
Welcome, welcome! If you{3}need it, we've got it!{3}See anything you need?{30}
I'm sorry, but you don't{3}have enough money.{1}
Who should I give it to?{30}
{18}{1} is carrying too{3}much already. Who should{3}I give it to?{30}
{18}{1} can't equip that.{3}Do you want it anyway?{30}
How many do you want?{30}
OK, it's all yours!{1}
Do you want {18}{1} to{3}equip it now?{30}
Wow, that's great, huh?{1}
Feel free to keep shopping!{30}
Come back soon!{2}
Looks like {18}{1} can't hold{3}any more stuff, huh? Who should{3}I give this {20}{1} to?{30}
Which would you like to buy?{30}
Do you need anything else?{30}
Which one should I take?{30}
Should I grab another?{30}
You can't get rid of the{3}{20}{1}, so you can't take{3}anything else. Come get it later.{1}
Terribly sorry,{3}but we don't carry those.{1}
You're selling that many?{30}
Hm...{20}{2}...{3}Does {22} coin{25} sound fair?{30}
This is really quite a find.{3}Does {22} coin{25} sound fair?{30}
The total comes to {22} coin{25}.{3}How's that sound?{30}
That {20}{1} is a bit worn...{3}How about...{22} coin{25}?{30}
Hm...{20}{2}... How{3}does {22} coin{25} sound?{30}
OK, here's your money.{1}
Well, that's the best I can{3}do. Oh well...{1}
There you go...{1}
I'm really not supposed to do{3}this, but I can be flexible...{1}
We're out of stock on our{3}bargain buys. Check with us{3}again in the near future.{2}
Ah, a bargain hunter, eh?{3}Nothing but great deals here!{1}What would you like?{30}
You need a little{3}repair work?{1}And what needs fixing, then?{30}
Terribly sorry, but we don't{3}carry {20}{1}{25}.{1}
Huh-hey! There's no scars{3}on this {20}{1}.{1}
Listen, about that... If you can't{3}equip that {20}{1}, then{3}we can't fix it, you know?{1}
Jeez, all that nonsense, and{3}you don't have enough money.{1}
Fixing this {20}{1}{3}will run you {22} coin{25}, OK?{30}
Too much for you?{3}Oh well... {1}
I'll keep this for you.{1}
The repair work is finished.{3}Here you go.{1}
Any other repairs?{30}
Here's {20}{2} for{3}you, as a little gift.{1}
Who should I give{3}the {20}{1} to?{30}
You don't need that, do you?{1}

The more numbers{3}that match, the more you{3}win.{2}
Lucky Dice{1}
If two numbers match on{3}either the dice or{3}the table...{1}
it's called a pair,{3}and you don't win or{3}lose anything.{1}

Whoa! Getting triple{3}digits is real tough!{2}
I don't want to stop{3}playing Lucky Dice, but{3}I can't spend anymore!{2}
Winning or losing{3}is pure luck. I ain't{3}cheatin' nobody.{2}
The rules for Lucky Dice{3}ain't all that hard.{1}Ya can even learn{3}'em while ya play.{2}
Sometimes, people who{3}have never played{3}Lucky Dice win the most.{1}They call that{3}beginner's luck.{2}
Thinking won't help{3}you win this game.{3}When I try to think{1}about how to throw the{3}dice, I lose. Maybe{3}I think too much.{2}
My luck has run out{3}for today. I better{3}quit playing.{2}

You can't carry any more{3}items. Are you sure{3}you want to play?{30}
If you win anything,{3}you might not be able{3}to take it with you.{1}Is that okay?{30}
Then get rid of some{3}items and come{3}again.{2}
Step right up and enjoy{3}yourself.{2}

{26}{1}: Toss
{26}{2}: Quit
I get nervous when I toss{3}coins backward. I wish{3}I could face forward...{2}
Why won't anyone{3}give me a Lucky Medal?{2}
This is a Lucky Medal,{3}so it should be OK{3}if I miss by a bit.{1}I need all the{3}good luck I can get.{2}
Hmm... I wonder if{3}these kids will take{3}all the best items...{2}
Welcome, welcome, step right up!{3}Care for a round of Super Lucky{3}Dice?{30}
OK, then let 'em roll!{2}
Oh really?{3}That's a shame!{2}
If you want to learn about{3}the rules to Super Lucky{3}Dice, just check out the sign.{2}
Super Lucky Dice{3}The Rules of the Game.{1}
Throw all four dice{3}onto the table in{3}a single toss.{1}
If two of the dice match,{3}it's a push, and you win{3}your money back.{1}
If three of the dice match,{3}you win back twice the bet{3}you placed.{1}
If you get two pairs of matching{3}dice, you win three times the{3}bet you placed. {1}
If all four dice match,{3}it's a perfect toss! You{3}win eight times your bet!{1}
If you get one pair, two pair,{3}three of a kind, or a perfect{3}four, you can play the hi-lo game!{1}
You have to guess whether the{3}next roll of the dice will be more{3}or less than your current total.{1}
If you win the hi-lo game, you{3}double your winnings! You can{3}do this up to five times.{2}
So, tell me, pal... Have you{3}ever played Superdice before?{30}
Yeah, but you've never won,{3}have you? I can see it in{3}your face.{2}
Now, this here's a simple game,{3}but it's my favorite dice game.{2}
If you lose the hi-lo game,{3}you don't win anything...{3}It's tough to know when to quit!{2}
I almost always get at least{3}one pair, but then I lose{3}everything on the hi-lo game!{2}
When they lose, they call me a{3}cheater. When they win, they call{3}it skill. Really, it's all just luck.{2}
It's not a tough game, not if{3}you play enough. You just{3}sorta learn as you play...{2}
This kid's got unlucky written{3}all over his face.{1}One unlucky person can{3}spoil it for everyone... I hope{3}he doesn't ruin my lucky streak.{2}
It's tough to know when{3}to keep playing and when{3}to cut your losses.{2}
I can win, I can win, I can win!{3}Whoa! ...I'm going to lose...{2}
Sorry, pal, but you've gotta{3}have more coins to play.{2}

It's our turn.{3}Let's go, {17}{5}.{2}
Hey, {17}{5}, I'm all{3}set to show you what I've got.{2}
If you want me to fight, I'll{3}do it, but don't expect anything{3}amazing from me.{2}
I'll do the best I can!{2}
?
Hey, I'll do my best if{3}you do yours!{2}
You don't even want to{3}try? I'll show you my power.{2}
All right, {17}{5}, we'll{3}do it together!{2}
OK, we're set, {17}{5}.{3}But remember, you're calling{3}the shots, all right?.{2}
What? I have to take a break?{3}Why do I have to do that?{2}
There's something really sad{3}about being told to stay behind.{2}
That's fine, I could use{3}some rest anyway.{2}
?
OK, I'll be waiting right here.{3}Do your best, and hurry back.{2}
Don't you want me with{3}you anymore, {17}{5}?{2}
Are you trying to tell me{3}something, {17}{5}?{2}
I'll fight enough for{3}both of us...{2}
If you don't want to fight,{3}that's fine. We'll do better{3}without you, no problem.{2}
Huh? No way!{3}Please fill in for me!{2}
I'll do the best I can.{2}
?
Wait, I say I'll fight, and then{3}you back out of it? What's{3}that all about?{2}
Good luck, {17}{5}!{3}If you want me, you know{3}where to find me.{2}
So it's just me. Is that{3}all right? I'm a little nervous.{2}
I don't care who I'm fighting;{3}I'm going to fight with{3}everything I've got.{2}
I'm looking forward to finding{3}out who I'm gonna thump.{2}
Now that I'm all ready to{3}fight, I'm not concerned{3}about losing at all...{2}
I'm not sure if my Psynergy{3}or my weapons will give me{3}the upper hand in battle...{2}
?
They can send in anyone they{3}want, because I'm going to knock{3}them all down flat!{2}
I hope we're fighting someone{3}big and strong. I like a challenge.{2}
Whatever we face, I'm sure{3}we can deal with it.{2}
I'll leave this up to you.{2}
All this waiting around is{3}boring! Hurry up and clean{3}their clocks!{2}
It doesn't fill me with confidence{3}to know you're not taking part.{2}
I only hope everybody comes{3}through this intact...{2}
?
I'd be more comfortable if{3}I were out there with you.{2}
If you leave me behind{3}and then lose, I'll never{3}forgive you!{2}
I just hope your aim{3}doesn't falter...{2}
Everybody deserves a little{3}credit for this victory!{2}
You can count on me,{3}through thick and thin!{2}
If I seemed nervous, it was{3}only because I wasn't sure{3}you were prepared for this.{2}
I'm glad we won... But don't{3}you feel at all bad for your{3}opponents?{2}
?
You know, you would never{3}have won without me.{2}
Yeah... That didn't offer a{3}lot of challenge.{2}
I gave it my best effort,{3}as you could see.{2}
Everybody did great! I didn't{3}worry at all about you!{2}
You won? Without me? Wow...{3}Way to make a guy feel{3}unneeded there.{2}
You really stayed cool in{3}the heat of battle. Good work!{2}
The most important thing is{3}that nobody got hurt. Except{3}your opponents.{2}
?
Sure, you won, but...it would{3}have been a lot easier if I'd{3}been there, huh?{2}
Oh, you won? Yeah, that's{3}great. But you still left me{3}behind!{2}
That was a stunning battle.{3}I was on the edge of my seat.{2}
Don't blame yourself... It{3}was just a bad strategy.{2}
Pull yourself together! We'll{3}do it next time.{2}
You should have picked{3}someone else. It's all my{3}fault that we lost.{2}
I didn't help out very much,{3}did I? I'm sorry...{2}
?
Wow. That was a serious{3}beating... What happened to us?{2}
I was doing my very best.{3}I certainly hope you were, too.{2}
Maybe it would have been{3}better if I just hadn't come...{2}
You win some, you lose some.{3}That's the nature of competition.{2}
What? You lost? That's what{3}you get for leaving me out!{2}
It's not a problem, {17}{5}.{3}You'll do better next time.{2}
I know I wasn't out there with{3}you, but...I still blame myself.{2}
?
Of course, you're going to{3}lose if you have such an{3}awful attitude about it!{2}
If you'd taken me with you,{3}none of this would ever have{3}happened. Don't you forget it.{2}
You should have asked for{3}my help. From the look of{3}things, you could have used it.{2}
I'm just going to watch.{3}But you guys are going{3}to battle, aren't you?{1}Well, do your best.{2}
{9}{4}I don't have the guts to fight{3}in the battle arena. I'll just{3}be sitting here, if that's OK.{2}
You look a little scrawny,{3}but guys like you are often{3}surprisingly strong...{2}
Fighting a guy with a build{3}like that would really wear{3}me out! Whew!{2}
I'll be rooting for you!{3}Do your best!{2}
I like my men macho.{3}You...don't work out{3}much, do you?{2}
Hm... It comes in like this...{3}Then you do this, and...{3}Whoa, that's not right...{2}
You could use Psynergy, Djinn,{3}even summons and items! There{3}are a lot of battle strategies...{2}
So you win against one guy,{3}and then you lose against{3}the next.{1}Depending on the foe,{3}you've got to change up{3}your tactics.{2}
I need to find a way to get{3}stronger, but I'm just out of{3}ideas. Maybe a nice smoothie?{2}
Sometimes, your class changes{3}when you unleash a Djinni.{1}You need to watch that, because{3}it can get you into some real{3}trouble if you're not careful.{2}
Should I enter or not?{3}I'm so stressed about this...{2}
It looks like this is{3}your first time here.{1}I will teach you{3}what it is like to{3}fight in a battle.{2}
You've won {22}{3}Linked Battle{25}. Keep up{3}the good work!{2}
It looks like this is{3}your first time here.{1}You can ask me about{3}the results of your{3}battle. Okay?{2}
You've won {22}{3}Linked Battle{25}.{1}Check the board on{3}the wall for the best{3}records so far.{2}
Up to three allies{3}can fight in Linked{3}Battle finals.{1}The results vary greatly{3}depending on who you{3}set what Djinn to.{2}
That was a great{3}battle..{3}What excitement!{2}
Too bad. Sometimes, you{3}have to be lucky to win.{3}Don't be too disappointed.{2}
Is this the Battle Arena{3}the old man spoke of?{3}I thought it was a{1}story of dreams. Or is{3}this the old man's{3}dream?{2}
Wow... You guys.{3}You are much stronger{3}than you look.{2}
What happened, you guys?{3}Try harder.{2}
You look a little scrawny,{3}but guys like you are often{3}surprisingly strong...{2}
Fighting a guy with a build{3}like that would really wear{3}me out! Whew!{2}
I'll be rooting for you!{3}Do your best!{2}
I like my men macho.{3}You...don't work out{3}much, do you?{2}
Hm... It comes in like this...{3}Then you do this, and...{3}Whoa, that's not right...{2}
Hm... It comes in like this...{3}Then you do this, and...{3}Whoa, that's not right...{2}
Hm... It comes in like this...{3}Then you do this, and...{3}Whoa, that's not right...{2}
I am a traveling warrior.{3}I came here to become{3}stronger...{1}Listen to me on{3}this: Don't underestimate{3}the monsters here...{2}
You aren't too bad.{3}But don't become too{3}arrogant from this{1}victory. Continue to{3}train yourselves.{2}
You have to train more.{1}Put your heart into{3}it when you fight.{2}
I will tell you your{3}total wins when you{3}finish the linked finals.{2}
I will tell you your{3}consecutive wins when{3}you finish the finals.{2}
You've won {22}{3}consecutive Monster{3}Battle{25}.{1}Keep up the good work!{2}
I can't wait to see how{3}many Monster Battles{3}you win.{1}I'll be counting{3}your victories!{2}
Up to three allies{3}can fight in the{3}linked finals.{1}There are four in your{3}party, so the rightmost{3}ally will have to pass.{2}
Up to three allies{3}can fight in the{3}linked finals...{1}So all of you can{3}fight!{2}
You can change the order{3}of your party in the{3}status screen.{1}But you knew that, right?{2}
Up to three allies can join{3}you in a Link Mode battle.{1}Your party has eight allies{3}total, so only the three allies{3}on the left of the list can fight.{2}
In the linked finals, you{3}can't delay after your{3}opponent selects a move.{1}If you don't choose your{3}command within 15 seconds,{3}you automatically defend.{2}
Monster Battle rules say{3}you all must fight as a{3}team against a monster.{1}If you're fighting as a{3}team, you can use the{3}same tactics...{1}you used in your travels.{2}
So you win against one guy,{3}and then you lose against{3}the next.{1}Depending on the foe,{3}you've got to change up{3}your tactics.{2}
You could use Psynergy, Djinn,{3}even summons and items! There{3}are a lot of battle strategies...{2}
Should I enter or not?{3}I'm so stressed about this...{2}
To use Summon quickly,{3}Djinn must be on{3}standby.{1}But to improve your class,{3}Djinn must be set...{3}Hmm... Choices, choices...{2}
Do you put Djinn on{3}standby before a battle,{3}or do you set them?{1}I usually set them to{3}raise my class before{3}I fight.{2}
Remove Djinn you rarely{3}use so you can{3}summon quickly.{1}I'm impatient, so I{3}prefer to fight in{3}short battles.{2}
Sometimes, your class changes{3}when you unleash a Djinni.{1}You need to watch that, because{3}it can get you into some real{3}trouble if you're not careful.{2}
All the warriors are{3}impressive, so I get edgy{3}before battles begin.{2}
I could enter, but I'd{3}just get hurt if I{3}did... That'd be stupid.{2}
You have a song request?{2}
Come back when you're{3}ready to rock!{2}

{9}{4}What are you doing???{7}{2}
Are you sure we should{3}be leaving like this?{2}
Once we go down those{3}stairs, we can't get back{3}into the lighthouse.{2}
Maybe I should have{3}stopped my brother...{2}
{17}{6}, is something{3}troubling you?{2}
I just...{2}
What is it? What's wrong?{2}
I have a bad feeling...{1}Like something terrible{3}is going to happen.{2}
How unlike you, {17}{6}.{2}
Surprised to see me?{2}
A-Alex...{3}Were you listening?{2}
Where's {17}{5}? Why isn't{3}he here with you?{2}
My brother?{3}He left us.{2}
What can {17}{5} possibly{3}be thinking?{2}
He was worried about {17}{7}.{3}He went to check on her.{2}
He was supposed to be{3}leading you out of here!{1}I thought you would have{3}been far from this lighthouse{3}by now.{2}
Why are you still here?{2}
We tried to stop {17}{5} from{3}going back up to the aerie.{2}
How like him. Once {17}{5}{3}gets an idea into his head,{3}he rarely changes his mind.{2}
Alex, what were you talking{3}about just now?{2}
What did you mean when{3}you said...{1}"How unlike you"?{2}
I was{5} merely surprised{3}to hear you expressing{3}such concern, {17}{6}.{2}
Nevertheless, I'm impressed{3}{17}{5} went back...{2}
Don't change the subject,{3}Alex! What did you mean!?{2}
Are you saying that{3}I'm insensitive!?{2}
If that's what you heard,{3}then I must have misspoken.{3}Accept my apologies.{2}
Well, {17}{6}, I think{3}Alex has said his piece{3}on the matter...{2}
I'm not sure he has,{3}Kraden.{2}
Who do you think you are,{3}talking to me like that!?{2}
I retract my statement,{3}my dear. Forget all about{3}it, {17}{6}.{2}
So tell me about this{3}"feeling," {17}{6}...{2}
I'm just...{5} I'm not sure we{3}should be leaving Venus{3}Lighthouse yet...{2}
What are you saying?{2}
You can't really mean{3}to remain here...{2}
Alex is right. It's far too{3}dangerous, {17}{6}.{1}We would only hinder{3}the others...{2}
The others? Did {17}{1}{3}follow us to the{3}lighthouse?{2}
It would seem so.{2}
He must be trying to stop{3}Saturos and Menardi!{2}
If my brother goes back and{3}finds {17}{1}, they're going{3}to end up fighting.{2}
If the Venus Lighthouse{3}has not yet been lit,{3}yes. They will fight.{2}
{17}{5} is a terribly rash{3}young man, is he not?{2}
Why are boys{3}such fools?{2}
He may be rash, but {17}{5}{3}is no fool.{1}His good qualities outweigh{3}his bad...{2}
That's why I think{3}{17}{1} would understand{3}if we just talked to him.{2}
Why didn't I think of this{3}before now?{2}
Please...{3}Can't we go back up{3}and talk to {17}{1}?{2}
I'm afraid that's{3}not possible.{2}
Alex, why?{2}
He is an enemy.{2}
{17}{1}? An enemy?{2}
Our methods may differ,{3}but you and I ultimately{3}want the same thing...{2}
To light the elemental{3}lighthouses...{2}
{17}{1} and his friends{3}would prevent this from{3}happening.{2}
So that makes them enemies?{2}
But fear not...{3}They won't be able to defeat{3}Saturos and Menardi.{2}
So... {17}{5} went back to{3}the top of the lighthouse?{2}
Why do you seem so{3}pleased, Alex?{2}
Why shouldn't I be? After all,{3}the lighthouse will soon shine{3}brightly once again!{2}
Alex, why do you want{3}to see the beacon lit{3}so badly?{2}
Oh, so it's my turn to answer{3}questions, is it?{2}
Once, Alchemy was commonplace{3}throughout this world...{2}
With its power, mankind worked{3}wonders across the land...{2}
The lost age of man...{2}
I want to see that world{3}restored once again, and...{2}
And what, Alex?{2}
We've spoken long enough{3}already. Let us continue{3}this another time.{2}
We should leave the{3}lighthouse now, before{3}the beacon is fired...{2}
I concur... Let's meet at the{3}location we agreed on{3}and wait for {17}{5}.{2}
All right, Kraden,{3}let's go.{2}
No, {17}{6}, not{3}that way.{1}We must get away from{3}the lighthouse.{2}
The chest was already open.{1}But it looks like there's{3}still {20}{2} inside!{2}
You found {20}{2}.{1}It looks like there's also{3}{20}{2} inside.{2}
There they are!{3}Get 'em!{2}
Iodem sent us to stand{3}guard here, but...{2}
I never thought we'd{3}actually run into them!{2}
Scoundrels! What have you{3}done with {17}{7}?{2}
Return her now, or you're{3}really going to regret it!{2}
Um...{5} Aren't there supposed{3}to be more of them?{2}
Huh... Maybe they're just the{3}first ones to come out...{2}
Great! That means we've{3}got 'em outnumbered!{2}
We can probably take{3}'em, you think?{2}
Go fetch the other Tolbi{3}soldiers still stationed{3}in Lalivero...{2}
Yes, sir!{2}
And we'll go tell the guys{3}in the caves!{2}
Got it, Boss!{2}
How unfortunate... It looks{3}like an ambush. What should{3}we do, {17}{6}?{2}
What do you mean? Look{3}around... We'll have to{3}fight them!{2}
Are you serious?{2}
{17}{6}, are you really prepared{3}to fight these men?{2}
We don't have any other{3}choice. We have to...{2}
Well, then. Allow me to{3}shoulder some of your{3}burden.{2}
...Burden?{2}
We regroup along the road{3}leading away from Lalivero.{3}Do you understand?{30}
You don't need to remind us,{3}Alex. We know the place.{2}
It's quite simple, {17}{6}.{3}The meeting place is in the{3}direction opposite Lalivero.{2}
Follow this road west, and{3}take the path down through{3}the canyon to the cave.{2}
On the other side of that{3}cave, you will find a small{3}peninsula called Idejima.{1}We meet there.{2}
Thankfully, only those{3}workmen block your route.{2}
And fortunately...{2}
They don't look too tough...{2}
Hello! We can hear you!!!{2}
That's just plain rude!{2}
Why don't the two of you{3}escape and leave the Tolbi{3}soldiers to me?{2}
The two of us? Alone?{2}
You can use Psynergy,{3}can't you, {17}{6}?{2}
Um... Yes.{2}
Then you'll be fine.{2}
We shall reconvene{3}at the peninsula.{2}
You think you can take on{3}Tolbi's finest on your own,{3}little man?{2}
I do not wish to inflict{3}unnecessary bloodshed.{2}
Don't wish to...{5}{3}What's that supposed{3}to mean?{2}
If you lay a hand on these{3}two, I assure you that you{3}will be made to regret it.{2}
By advancing, I assume you{3}mean to fight. Permit me{3}to strike the first blow.{2}
What was {9}{4}that{7}!?{2}
I don't know, but whatever{3}he did, it's out of our{3}league!{2}
You guys deal with him{3}until backup arrives!{2}
Oh, so you're next?{2}
Hey, no need to{3}worry about us!{2}
We're not soldiers...{3}We're not anybody!{2}
Seriously, there's no{3}way we're gonna face{3}off against you.{2}
Let's get outta here!{2}
How undignified...{3}and how shameful.{2}
{17}{6}, now is your{3}chance. Go to Idejima{3}and wait for me.{2}
I'm not finished{3}with you yet.{2}
You mentioned backup{3}from Lalivero?{2}
Let's go meet them{3}together, shall we?{2}
Hey, pal! When they{3}get here, you'll really{3}be in for it!{2}
Do you honestly believe{3}that even a hundred of{3}you could stop me?{2}
How amusing...{3}This I must see.{2}
They're gone...{2}
Come on, {17}{6}...{3}Let's be going.{2}
There's nothing standing{3}in our way now!{2}
But...{2}
What is it now?{2}
Ah... You're worried about{3}hurting any innocents?{30}
Well, just try to hold back{3}when you're fighting.{2}
Oh. You must be concerned{3}about {17}{5}. We can't do{3}anything to help him here.{2}
Let's get going!{3}To the peninsula!{2}
{17}{6}... Are...{3}Are you all right?{2}
Ah, {17}{6}...{3}You're awake.{2}
Can you stand?{2}
It's a good thing I came{3}back for you two...{2}
Perhaps you ought to{3}come with us this time...{2}
No. Someone has to keep{3}Tolbi's soldiers at bay.{2}
I'll have to go to Lalivero{3}and confront them there.{2}
We'll meet at Idejima.{2}
He's gone again.{2}
And we'd best be{3}going as well...{2}
{17}{6}, escape{3}to the boat!{2}
Why do I gotta be the{3}one to wait for backup!?{2}
Yaaah! P-P-Please!{3}Just let me go, and...{3}Hey!{2}
That scary guy with the{3}blue hair's not with you...{2}
Great! Now, you'll see{3}what I'm really made of!{2}
Ugggh. I can't believe I{3}got beaten by a girl...{2}
Waahhh! It's them!{2}
Whoa there... Where'd the{3}blue-haired guy go?{2}
Who cares! I can handle{3}some girl and her grandpa!{2}
Ooooog. Maybe I shouldn't{3}have underestimated her...{2}
Ha! That was a good idea,{3}waiting here for 'em!{2}
You two aren't going{3}anywhere!{2}
Except with us, back{3}to Master Iodem!{2}
Maybe I should have{3}eaten a bigger breakfast.{2}
All right, so maybe you{3}are going somewhere{3}after all...{2}
Oh, man... There goes{3}my big promotion...{2}
My! That was invigorating!{3}He wasn't too strong...{2}
I never knew fighting could{3}be so fun!{5} Ah, but we'd better{3}get on to the peninsula...{2}
Not that way, {17}{6}!{3}The meeting spot{3}is west of here.{1}We must go down that{3}road and into the hills.{2}
Not that way, {17}{6}!{3}The meeting spot{3}is down this way.{1}We must climb down here{3}and go into that cave.{2}
There are words carved{3}into the relief...{1}If ye seek to climb{3}Venus Lighthouse, first{3}seek the power within.{1}To obtain this power, see{3}with the eyes of truth.{3}Then the way shall open.{1}But the path I reveal is{3}not the beginning.{1}The true beginning lies{3}down ancient pathways{3}on distant soils.{2}
The true road can only{3}be known by he who bears{3}a true heart.{2}
This is the place,{3}isn't it?{30}
The peninsula at the end{3}of the road to the west...{3}That's what he told us.{2}
This must be Idejima!{2}
Hm... Menardi said a ship{3}would be here...{2}
We ought to see if{3}we can find it.{2}
{17}{6}, it's over here!{2}
At first glance, it seems{3}like a normal ship, but...{2}
There's something {5}odd{3}about it...{2}
Kraden, wait! Oh, I swear!{3}You're like a kid with a{3}new toy!{2}
Hurry up in there!{2}
What's wrong?{2}
It's missing...{2}
Hm? What are you{3}talking about?{2}
The thingie...{3}that makes it go.{2}
What do you mean? What's so{3}important about this...thingie?{2}
The boat can't move without it...{2}
That Menardi!{3}She tricked us!{2}
Tricked us?{2}
Yeah, by passing this{3}dud boat off on us!{2}
There's no trick. If this{3}boat is a dud, how did it{3}get here in the first place?{2}
Oh, right.{2}
It must have been{3}the orb...{2}
What orb?{2}
Don't you remember that{3}crystal Saturos was{3}carrying?{2}
That big, black pearl thing?{2}
I'm certain he said he{3}could move the ship{3}with it.{2}
{17}{6}, Kraden!{2}
There you are.{2}
I see you've found{3}the boat.{2}
We set sail as soon as the{3}beacon has been fired,{3}correct?{2}
Strange...{2}
What is it?{2}
The beacon...{3}It hasn't been lit yet.{2}
You're right...{3}Why is it taking so long?{2}
And why hasn't my{3}brother returned?{2}
They've done it, {17}{6}!{3}They've lit the beacon!{2}
What's happening, Kraden!?{3}Why won't the ground stop{3}shaking?{2}
Strange... I think it might{3}actually be getting worse!{2}
I think the lighthouse is{3}collapsing! Look! The ground{3}around it is crumbling!{2}
Mercury Lighthouse didn't{3}react this way... What{3}makes Venus different?{2}
That last tremor tore a{3}rift in the Suhalla Range!{2}
How are we going to get{3}back to Gondowan now!?{2}
Idejima... It's drifting away{3}from the mainland!{2}
But...what will{3}happen to us?{2}
Oh, Kraden... How long{3}will this island{3}continue to drift?{2}
I don't know...{3}I wish you could{3}tell me.{2}
Sheesh... You're no help{3}in times like this.{2}
Hey, I'm hungry...{2}
How can you even{3}think about food?{2}
I wonder what happened{3}to my brother...{2}
I can't be certain,{5} but{3}it looks like they lit{3}the Venus beacon.{2}
Yeah, I know. You don't have to{3}tell me that. That's how we{3}wound up adrift at sea, right?{2}
My, aren't you cranky{3}today, {17}{6}!{2}
Well,{5} I suppose you're{3}just worried about{3}{17}{5}.{2}
{17}{1} and the others{3}must have been at the{3}lighthouse, too.{2}
I suspect you're right...{2}
I miss them...{3}{17}{1}... {17}{5}...{2}
Come with me.{2}
There is something I wish{3}to show you.{2}
{17}{5}... {17}{7}...
{17}{7}! {17}{5}!
They... {5}They're alive...{2}
They're really alive!{2}
What is this?{3}Alex, what happened?{2}
I thought {17}{5} and{3}{17}{7} were still{3}inside the lighthouse.{2}
It's miraculous...{2}
Miracle or no, I'm just{3}happy my brother's alive.{2}
What happened back there?
...
{17}{7}...{2}
{9}{4}Oh...{7}{2}
Thank the elements,{3}she's awake!{2}
{17}{7}, are you all right?{3}It's me, {17}{6}.{2}
{17}{6}?{2}
What...happened?{2}
It seems you drifted{3}here with {17}{5}.{2}
With {17}{5}...?{2}
Take your time... Do you{3}feel all right, {17}{7}?{2}
Where are we?{2}
Idejima. We were all to{3}meet here...{1}But now, the island is{3}floating away from Gondowan.{2}
This island is{5} moving?{2}
I know it must be very{3}hard to believe, {17}{7}.{2}
When the Venus Lighthouse{3}was lit, a massive tremor{3}tore us off the continent...{2}
The ground beneath the{3}lighthouse roiled, as though{3}it might crumble away.{2}
I remember now...{3}And that's what carried{3}us away from Gondowan.{2}
But what happened to{3}you, {17}{7}?{1}You were in the sea,{3}and Saturos{176}{2}
Saturos and Menardi{3}are gone...{2}
What do you mean?{2}
Another group came...{3}They fought Saturos and{3}Menardi and won.{2}
Was it {17}{1}?{2}
{17}{1}...{3}Yes, I think that's what{3}they called him...{2}
You expect me to believe{3}{17}{1} and his companions{3}defeated Saturos and Menardi?{2}
Have they really grown{3}so powerful in so short{3}a time?{2}
But how did you wind{3}up in the sea?{2}
When the beacon was lit,{3}the earthquake knocked me{3}off the lighthouse tower.{2}
Then what's my brother{3}doing here?{2}
He tried to save me{3}from drowning...{2}
{17}{5} jumped from the top{3}of the lighthouse!?{3}Dear me!{2}
{17}{5}...{3}are you awake?{2}
Ah! {17}{5}, you're awake!{2}
Brother...{2}
Are you sure you should{3}be standing?{2}
You don't seem very{3}surprised to find yourself{3}on a floating island.{2}
{17}{5}, once you'd saved{3}{17}{7}, you must have{3}swum out here, correct?{2}
You must have seen that{3}this island was floating{3}when you were swimming.{2}
But what do we do now?{2}
I have no idea. Nobody{3}knows what lies beyond{3}the Eastern Sea.{2}
Unfortunately, I am a{3}student of Alchemy,{3}not geography...{2}
What is it...Alex?{2}
What's the matter?{2}
Can't you see it?{2}
It's land! An island!{2}
It's a little...{3}big for an island.{2}
That's no island...{3}It's a new continent!{2}
We're saved!{2}
So it would seem...{2}
Wait...{2}
What is it?{2}
We're going to pass north{3}of the continent...{2}
She's right!{2}
I don't think we're going{3}to make it!{2}
Oh, Kraden... {17}{5}...{3}What are we going to do?{2}
???{2}
Oh... This can't be good.{2}
What...is it?{2}
It's...a tidal wave.{2}
A tidal wave?{2}
The earthquake must{3}have caused it!{2}
Oh... Oh my... It's{3}coming right at us!{2}
Alex... How can you{3}stay so calm at a{3}time like this?{2}
At times like this, where{3}would be the good in{3}panicking?{2}
We'll be washed away!{2}
Help!!!{2}
Do you want to check{3}yourself for injuries?{30}
Looks like the arms are{3}still attached. That's a{3}good start.{2}
The legs are working{3}fine, too.{5} Yup. You're fine!{2}
You walk around a bit,{3}and everything seems fine.{2}
Oooog...{2}
Oh... {17}{5}...{2}
Ouch...{2}
That was quite a blow...{2}
What happened when{3}that wave hit?{2}
{17}{5}, look!{2}
That wave carried us{3}to the continent!{2}
We've hit solid land!{3}Let's go, {17}{5}!{2}
Kraden has joined{3}your party.{2}
What...{2}
What am I doing{3}down here?{2}
Oh... I must have blacked{3}out when the wave hit...{2}
Hey! We've hit land!{2}
That wave must have{3}carried us here! What luck!{2}
Have you checked everyone{3}else? Are they all right?{30}
Great! Then let's go!{2}
{17}{6} has joined{3}your party.{2}
Then let's go find them{3}and get off this island!{2}
{17}{6} has{3}joined your party.{2}
Ohhh...{2}
Nnng.{2}
The wave!{2}
What happened to{3}the tidal wave?{2}
I thought we were done{3}for, but we're all fine...{2}
And we've run aground!{2}
That tidal wave turned out{3}to be a stroke of luck!{2}
I wonder where we are...{2}
We should take a look around!{2}
{17}{7} has{3}joined your party.{2}
Hey, {17}{5}!{2}
You weren't planning on{3}leaving me, were you?{2}
Hm?{2}
Well! It's land!{2}
The wave carried us{3}back ashore!{2}
I assume you merely...forgot{3}about me in your excitement?{2}
Understandable, but you{3}should have waited for{3}me, {17}{5}.{2}
Nevertheless, let us{3}be on our way!{2}
Kraden has{3}joined your party.{2}
I can't believe you two!{2}
How could you!?{2}
Leaving me on that island{3}while you go off exploring{3}on your own!{2}
And here I was, looking{3}everywhere for you!{2}
I'm sorry, my dear...{3}Can you ever forgive us?{2}
Oh...{5} All right. Just don't{3}leave me alone like that{3}again...{2}
Anyway, look!{3}That wave must have carried{3}us to a new continent!{2}
Let's go exploring!{2}
{17}{6} has{3}joined your party.{2}
Wa-Wait!{2}
Aren't you worried about{3}me in the slightest?{2}
Did you rescue me from the{3}lighthouse just to leave me{3}for dead on this island?{2}
Now, I'm sure he meant{3}to do no such thing...{2}
I wonder...{2}
Oh, don't give me that{3}sad face... You know I{3}can't stay mad at you...{2}
After all, you did save{3}me, {17}{5}. I won't{3}soon forget that...{2}
But don't leave me behind{3}like that again, OK?{2}
So that big wave pushed us{3}aground? Way to go, Nature!{2}
What's out here, anyway?{2}
That's what we were{3}about to find out!{2}
Let's get started, then!{2}
{17}{7} has{3}joined your party.{2}
By the way...{3}Where has Alex gone?{2}
He doesn't seem to be{3}anywhere on the island.{2}
You don't think he set{3}out on his own, do you?{30}
Then I guess there's no{3}reason to look for him here.{2}
Well, he's no longer on{3}Idejima, at any rate.{2}
He might have gone{3}to look for a ship.{2}
Alex wants a ship?{2}
Did you forget what{3}he was saying?{30}
He wants to return Alchemy{3}to its former place in the world.{2}
Then you know he wants{3}to restore Alchemy to the{3}world.{2}
By lighting the four{3}elemental lighthouses, he{3}might just succeed.{2}
But why the ship?{2}
The remaining two{3}lighthouses are{3}unreachable by land.{2}
None remain to be lit{3}across the Eastern Sea.{2}
So what should we{176}{2}
We must go to the Great{3}Western Sea...{2}
The Western Sea...{2}
Is that where we're going,{3}{17}{5}?{30}
Well said, {17}{5}!{3}And go there, we shall!{2}
Don't be foolish, {17}{5}.{3}We must pursue Alex.{3}We have to go there...{2}
That's right! Our parents'{3}lives depend on it!{2}
What about you, {17}{7}?{2}
What do you mean?{2}
It's...not going to be{3}an easy trip.{2}
And there is no reason you{3}should have to face that{3}danger... Right, {17}{5}?{30}
Then you should know my{3}reason for traveling with{3}all of you, {17}{5}...{2}
{17}{5} remembers...{3}I have a reason to be{3}traveling with you...{2}
What do you mean,{3}{17}{7}? What reason?{2}
It's{5} my destiny...{2}
This quest is your...{3}destiny?{2}
And you couldn't tell us{3}about this earlier?{2}
But how can we trust{3}you when we don't know{3}why you're with us?{2}
I'm sorry... But please,{3}you have to take me!{3}You must! You need me!{2}
I don't understand.{3}Why exactly do we{3}need you?{2}
You know that I am{3}an Adept, don't you?{2}
I can control the wind,{3}as {17}{5} already{3}knows...{2}
You knew that she{3}was a Wind Adept?{30}
Saturos must have mentioned{3}it atop the lighthouse...{3}I see...{2}
Saturos must have known{3}it, even though he never{3}told you...{2}
They saw that I was a{3}Wind Adept right away...{2}
They kidnapped me for{3}my powers... They needed{3}them on their journey.{2}
Oh, yeah... They would have{3}needed an alignment that{3}complemented their own.{2}
They said they would need{3}a Wind Adept in order to{3}light Jupiter's beacon.{2}
Ah, of course... And I{3}suspect we'll need your{3}power there as well.{2}
So you see, you{3}do need me.{2}
All right... I guess{3}I understand now.{2}
But you want to know what she{3}meant by destiny, too, don't you?{30}
I wish we could read{3}minds like {17}{7}.{3}Then we'd know...{2}
Oh, so it's just me?{3}Too bad I can't read{3}minds like {17}{7}, huh?{2}
I'm sure she will tell us{3}in her own time.{3}{5}Won't you, {17}{7}?{2}
I think, for now, that we{3}should simply trust {17}{7}.{2}
Now, I am quite famished.{3}Shall we get moving?{2}
You don't look familiar.{3}Have you been to Daila before?{30}
Strange... I just don't{3}remember ever seeing{3}you around here before.{2}
Well then, welcome to Daila,{3}the northernmost town on{3}the continent of Indra!{2}
We were hit by a gigantic{3}tidal wave, but there were{3}no injuries...{1}It was miraculous!{2}
Didn't it feel like all of Indra{3}moved when that wave hit?{30}
I knew it!{3}You felt it, too!{5} And that{3}shock afterward!{1}It felt like the whole{3}continent got rammed{3}into something!{2}
Wow... The wave must have{3}knocked you silly if you{3}didn't notice it...{2}
I saw a bright light in the{3}northwestern sky earlier...{3}Somewhere over Gondowan.{1}It was right before the tidal{3}wave... I wonder if there's{3}a connection...{2}
Thank goodness for that{3}mountain range to the{3}north...{1}If that range weren't there,{3}we would have been{3}washed away for sure...{2}
Ohhh...that wave knocked{3}me over, and now I can't{3}get up.{1}I must have been{3}born to suffer!{2}
That ancient tower to the{3}east? It's the Shrine of the{3}Sea God...{1}Listen, if you're not into{3}being cursed horribly, you{3}should stay away from there.{2}
Riki and Tavi sure{3}are out late...{2}
I wonder if those two{3}are still out there...{3}They know it's off-limits.{2}
Our village survived the{3}wave, but all our boats{3}were destroyed...{1}We won't be sailing for{3}a while, but we'll pull{3}through somehow...{2}
Hm? You want a boat?{30}
What kind of insensitive{3}jerk are you?{1}Everyone knows all our{3}boats were destroyed by{3}the tidal wave!{2}
Of course not!{3}The tidal wave ruined{3}all our boats...{1}Asking us for a boat now{3}would be just plain mean!{2}
That tidal wave left a lot{3}of standing water in our{3}village...{1}The worst part is that{3}it's all salt water.{2}
Yaaay! Puddles in the{3}village! Yaaay!{2}
Bleah! I fell in a puddle{3}and got my clothes dirty!{3}Mom's gonna have a fit!{2}
That wave turned this place{3}into a swamp! Everything{3}smells like brine!{2}
That must have been one{3}serious wave to make the{3}whole continent move...{1}I didn't even know{3}continents did that!{2}
I thought I saw some lights{3}in the northwestern skies...{3}Maybe I just imagined them.{2}
The sea god must have saved{3}us from the wave. It's good we{3}have a shrine honoring him.{2}
My hip's killing me, and all{3}that woman cares about is{3}how muddy my clothes are!{1}She cares more about the{3}laundry than she does me!{2}
I can't believe those{3}children play in the shrine!{1}It's dangerous, and it will{3}only bring them misfortune...{2}
The Shrine of the Sea God{3}stopped the wave, but I'm{3}worried...{1}Riki and Tavi were{3}playing in there, and I'm{3}too scared to tell anyone.{2}
I can't believe those losers{3}were inside the shrine when{3}the wave hit!{1}If Riki and Tavi want{3}to be idiots, I say, let 'em!{2}
That wave was brutal!{3}It smashed my boat{3}to splinters!{2}
With all the boats gone,{3}we sailors are stuck here!{1}What are we supposed{3}to do on dry land? Knit!?{2}
With all this salt water{3}on the ground, what will{3}happen to our crops?{2}
Yay! We never get puddles{3}like this, not even when{3}it rains!{2}
Bleccch!{3}This water's saaalty!{2}
Riki's really in for it{3}when he gets home!{1}He's been out playing{3}with his friend for days!{2}
That no-good kid of mine!{3}Taking his father's fishing{3}pole! I mean, really!{1}If he doesn't come home{3}soon, he's really going to{3}get it!{2}
Riki, Tavi... Where are{3}you? What are you up to?{2}
That Tavi's a bad{3}influence on Riki...{1}Just because he lives{3}next door doesn't mean{3}they have to be friends!{2}
I wonder where our{3}little Tavi has gone.{3}I'm getting worried.{1}He was gone when the{3}wave hit, and he hasn't{3}been home since...{2}
Tavi never misses{3}three o'clock snacksies!{1}Where could he be?{3}His food's getting cold...{2}
I'll bet that, wherever{3}Tavi is, Riki is{3}with him...{1}The neighbors must be{3}pretty worried, too.{2}
If Tavi isn't home{3}soon, we're going to have{3}to go looking for him.{2}
If you're looking for a{3}boat, you might check{3}in Madra...{1}Head south, and then when{3}the road forks, follow{3}the path to the east.{2}
If you head south, you'll{3}find a fork in the road.{1}Take the road west, and{3}you'll hit the Kandorean{3}Temple in no time.{2}
I wonder how the road{3}to Madra is holding up{3}after that flood...{1}The ground was always{3}pretty soft around there...{2}
I wonder if the holy man{3}at the Kandorean Temple is{3}as powerful as they say...{2}
In all my years as mayor,{3}I've never seen a wave{3}like that before...{1}I'm grateful that nobody{3}was seriously injured.{2}
The wave was awful, but{3}the noise that followed{3}was even worse...{1}The shock alone could{3}probably have destroyed{3}the road to Madra.{2}
A lot of folk said they{3}heard a terrible rumbling{3}from the southeast.{1}You ask me, it was the{3}road to Madra crumbling{3}to bits...{2}
Between the pirates and{3}the tidal waves, this{3}town has the worst luck!{1}Now that Briggs has been{3}arrested in Madra, maybe{3}our luck is changing...{2}
At least, nobody seems to{3}have been injured too badly.{1}Maybe I should make{3}another inspection later.{2}
I still don't know what{3}that sound I heard was...{1}With everything that's been{3}going on lately, I'm still a{3}little bit edgy...{2}
We should find a different{3}way to get to Madra. That{3}shoddy road's a mess...{2}
Now that Briggs is locked{3}away, we shouldn't have any{3}pirate trouble this year.{1}Of course, that tidal wave{3}did more damage than those{3}pirates ever managed...{2}
You folks ain't thinkin'{3}'bout goin' south, are ya?{1}The roads to the south{3}are a real mess from the{3}earthquake. Dangerous, too.{2}
I'm glad I'm not going to{3}Madra now... It had been{3}so parched for so long...{1}And now, after the quake,{3}I'm sure it's full of cracks{3}and fissures and gaps...{2}
You guys look new 'round{3}these parts! What brings{3}you to here?{1}There's nothing much to see{3}on this forsaken continent.{3}You must be odd folk indeed!{2}
If those two scamps knew{3}there were travelers in town,{3}they'd have a field day.{2}
I haven't seen Tavi and{3}Riki around lately...{1}I like those little guys,{3}so I'm kind of worried{3}about 'em.{2}
I'm sure those two went to{3}the Shrine of the Sea God.{3}They never listen!{1}I told them they were{3}way too small to climb{3}those cliffs...{2}
What should I cook for our{3}guests tonight? I just can't{3}decide.{2}
We run a very small inn, so{3}we make do with just the{3}two of us working here...{2}
I don't know when I'll be{3}able to return to Madra. I{3}sure miss the food there.{2}
I hear the seafood in{3}Madra is wonderful!{1}I wonder what kinds of{3}fish they catch in Madra...{2}
We can't sail, and we can't{3}fish... Not with our ships in{3}this condition...{1}{9}{4}Oh...{7} I'm not looking{3}forward to becoming{3}a vegetarian...{2}
Look at all these guests!{3}We need more help...but{3}how will we afford it?{2}
After all that shaking, I{3}wouldn't be surprised if{3}the roads were unusable.{2}
I'm so torn... Do I like{3}my fish grilled?{1}Or do I prefer poached?{3}It's hard to say... Why is{3}life so difficult?{2}
Travelers! Well, I'll be!{3}Do you have a lot of time{3}and nowhere to go?{30}
Then I suggest you visit{3}the Kandorean Temple to{3}see Master Poi.{1}He performs great feats,{3}but I'll warn you, he might{3}not let you in...{2}
Oh, going to Madra, are you?{1}It's a dangerous road,{3}but no one will stop you{3}from taking it, my children.{2}
Travelers with nowhere to{3}go... This is bad. I hope they{3}stay out of the shrine...{1}If they anger the sea god,{3}there's nowhere they could{3}hide, not anywhere in Indra!{2}
Have you come to{3}see Master Poi?{30}
The master will see no one.{3}Leave now, and do not{3}return.{2}
I'm sorry, but the temple{3}is closed to sightseers.{3}Go home now.{2}
Once the period of meditation{3}has begun, none may enter{3}the temple grounds.{1}Master Poi's teachings{3}require absolute concentration.{2}
I do not understand Master{3}Poi. If I were him, I would{3}allow more people to enter.{1}Instead, I must turn away{3}the very people who would{3}benefit from his teachings.{2}
I was hoping to hear Master{3}Poi speak. Instead, I got{3}guard duty. How boring...{2}
I hope to enter the temple{3}one day... I want to learn{3}from the master himself...{2}
Please don't break{3}my concentration!{1}I am...lighter than air...{3}floating, rising up...{2}
I am not just meditating.{3}I am guarding the entry{3}as well. It is important work.{1}But someday, I will be{3}permitted to enter{3}the temple...{2}
I still can't believe that{3}the older monks can{3}levitate through meditation.{1}If I work hard enough,{3}maybe I'll be able to do{3}it, too. Maybe.{2}
My mind is empty;{3}my body is light...{3}Now...float...float...{2}
Empty the mind{3}to lighten the body...{1}I've been fasting for{3}days... I've got to be{3}light enough by now!{2}
You there!{3}Focus your mind!{2}
Did you see that, Master?{2}
No, no, no!{3}You lack discipline!{2}
Now, you!{2}
How was that, Master?{2}
Improving...slowly!{3}Continue your meditation!{2}
Your turn!{2}
Master, have I done it?{2}
Not bad...{3}You might stand a{3}chance to succeed...{2}
I can do it, Master!{3}Please, just let me try!{2}
Your skills lack polish...{3}It may be dangerous. Do{3}you still wish to enter?{2}
Yes, I do! I do!{2}
If you fail, you may{3}lose more than just{3}your pride...{2}
I do not fear death, Master!{2}
Ho ho! Is that so?{2}
Very well, then!{3}It is time for your{3}trial, my son!{2}
Enter the cave,{3}and ascend!{2}
HE went in before ME?{3}What nonsense!{1}Wait... I guess I ought{3}to be supportive and{3}hope for his success...{2}
Empty mind, empty body.{3}By clearing my thoughts,{3}I can ascend...{2}
There's no way I'm rooting{3}for that loser!{1}Choke! Choke! Fail the test!{3}Then, I'll get my chance!{2}
Arrgh! I was so close!{3}I can't believe I didn't{3}make it!{1}Gah... I'm so consumed{3}with frustration that I{3}can't clear my thoughts...{2}
It seems I may not have{3}been ready after all...{1}I should start my{3}meditations over again...{2}
Is it really possible{3}for anyone to pass{3}this test?{2}
You have passed a very{3}difficult test. You have{3}pleased your teacher!{2}
Wait... You're not one of my{3}students! Who are you!?{2}
How did you...{3}come this far?{2}
Ah, yes... How indeed?{2}
The rope is still{3}on the floor.{2}
You must have come{3}through the cave...{2}
That means...{2}
I must give you...{3}the secret of Lash!{2}
Master Poi...{3}You seem perturbed.{2}
Oh, no...{3}Not at all...{2}
{17}{5}, am I imagining it,{3}or does he seem perturbed?{30}
I am not perturbed.{3}Merely...surprised.{2}
No one from outside the{3}temple has ever passed{3}the test. It's amazing...{2}
What is this "Lash" you{3}mentioned a moment ago?{2}
Lash is a sacred power,{3}passed down for years to{3}the followers of this temple.{2}
A sacred power? And{3}it's called Lash,{3}you say?{2}
And now, I must pass it{3}on to you. It is our way.{2}
It is a gift given to all those{3}who pass the test, as it{3}has been for ages.{2}
What type of power{3}is this Lash?{2}
Allow me to show you.{2}
Lash looks quite a bit{3}like Psynergy, doesn't it?{30}
Psynergy, hm?{3}We call it spiritual strength,{3}but it seems the same.{2}
I do not know of your{3}Psynergy, but our power{3}comes from within.{2}
This technique uses{3}the spiritual to affect{3}the physical.{2}
One with a strong spirit{3}can lift and move heavy{3}objects farther.{2}
The distance changes with{3}your level of power?{3}Fascinating!{2}
Those who cannot pass{3}this cave's trials are not{3}worthy of the technique.{2}
{17}{5}, do you think this{3}cave was designed to test{3}one's control of Psynergy?{30}
Yes, yes!{3}Well done, old man!{2}
Who are you calling an{3}old man!? You're no spring{3}chicken yourself!{2}
You are quite mistaken...{3}You should listen to the{3}old man. He speaks wisely.{2}
Tha{176}HEY! Who are you{3}calling an old man? You're{3}no schoolboy yourself!{2}
I wondered if it would be{3}right to allow an outsider{3}to use this power...{2}
You're...not going{3}to teach us?{2}
But I like you, so I will{3}let you learn our secret.{2}
Please, follow me.{2}
Take the power of{3}Lash. It is yours now.{2}
This is the power and the{3}secret of our temple!{2}
If you are worthy, you{3}will use it with ease!{2}
When you see a rope,{3}use Lash on it...{2}
Perhaps you will find this{3}useful on your travels.{2}
Take this power with{3}you, and do good.{2}
I hope that someday, my{3}students will be worthy{3}of this honor, too.{2}
If you wish to practice,{3}these caves may hold a{3}place of interest to you...{2}
Ho ho! I feel the strength{3}of your spirit flowing{3}toward me! Splendid!{2}
You were the ones{3}who passed the test?{30}
Wow! I can't believe it!{3}Are you monks? Where{3}did you study!?{2}
Well, if it wasn't you,{3}who was it?{2}
I hear that someone{3}passed the test...{3}No matter, though...{1}I am here to improve{3}myself, to meditate...{3}Not to show off.{2}
When I awoke, I learned{3}that someone else had passed{3}my test... How disgraceful.{2}
The master seemed so{3}disappointed that someone{3}passed the test...{1}I think it was just that{3}none of his students{3}can do it yet...{2}
I knew it!{3}It should have been{3}me taking that test!{2}
Before I passed out,{3}I saw...something...{1}Some sort of...cute little{3}monster. Was I delirious?{2}
Hey, what's an outsider{3}doing on the temple{3}grounds?{1}Oh, meditation must be{3}over... That's why they{3}let you in...{2}
Looks like none of our{3}brothers passed this time,{3}either.{1}At this rate, maybe we'll{3}be able to surpass them{3}after all.{2}
Someday, I'm going to{3}be a great monk, like{3}Master Poi.{2}
Gah! I kept my eyes shut in{3}meditation so long that the{3}sun hurts when I open them!{2}
I've been meditating all{3}day, but my body just{3}doesn't want to float...{2}
Whenever the master goes{3}to town, the villagers are{3}all in such awe of him...{1}Maybe someday, they'll{3}look at me the same way.{2}
Extinguish your desire,{3}and the fire will cool.{1}Empty your mind,{3}and you will feel no pain!{3}                    -Poi-{2}
{9}{2}Ouch!{2}
This wall looks rather{3}suspicious, wouldn't you{3}say, {17}{5}?{2}
Fantastic work, {17}{5}!{3}Keep a watchful eye for{3}any strange-looking areas!{2}
All right! I'm gonna{3}throw the rope again!{2}
Just don't miss{3}this time!{2}
Aww, no!{3}You missed again!{2}
Sorry, Tavi...{3}I can't do it!{2}
I thought I got lucky{3}when that wave carried{3}me up here...{2}
What are you, crazy? It{3}knocked you stupid{3}for a good ten minutes!{2}
Yeah, yeah!{3}Just find some way to{3}get me down from here!{2}
Fine! Just don't jump{3}down or do anything{3}dumb, OK?{2}
Wah! You scared me!{2}
I thought you were one{3}of the grown-ups from{3}Daila... {5}So, who are you?{2}
Look, I'm kinda busy trying{3}to help my pal Tavi{3}right now, OK?{2}
I can't find anything{3}around here that'll help{3}get him down from there!{2}
Excellent work, {17}{5}!{2}
Hey, the rope!{2}
Awesome, Riki!{3}Way to go!{2}
Who are you?{2}
We're just passing through.{2}
How come you threw{3}me the rope?{2}
We'd heard that you{3}needed some assistance.{2}
Well, whatever.{3}Thanks anyway.{2}
Hey, Tavi!{2}
How'd ya get{3}down from there?{2}
These guys threw{3}me the rope...{2}
Really? These grown-ups?{2}
Well, whatever.{3}Now we can go nab{3}that critter we saw!{2}
What? What is it?{2}
That little guy's so fast,{3}I can't catch him!{2}
Do you think we could{3}catch him together?{2}
Well, yeah, except that{3}every time I'm about to{3}grab him, he flies off!{2}
So I guess it wouldn't{3}matter if we worked{3}together or not.{2}
Yeah, I guess not.{2}
Well, that's too bad.{2}
Hey, I'm really hungry!{3}I haven't eaten since{3}before I got stuck!{2}
Yeah, same here...{3}My stomach's growling{3}up a storm!{2}
Let's go home, Riki.{2}
Sounds good, Tavi.{2}
They're gone...{2}
Well, it was good of{3}you to help them.{2}
We should be going, too.{2}
This statue looks a lot like{3}the one in Daila's Sanctum.{2}
I took all the money that was{3}in here to pay for a boat.{1}Don't think badly of me.{3}-Alex.{2}
After that wave hit, I was{3}worried about Daila, but{3}we're pulling through...{2}
Sure are a lot of travelers{3}coming through here today.{1}That last one, though...{3}He was awful cute.{2}
Those puddles of sea-{3}water the wave left have{3}almost all evaporated now.{2}
Ah, the sea is calm again,{3}and we can all get back{3}to our normal lives.{2}
I bet you thought it was{3}the wave that knocked me{3}over and hurt my hip, huh?{30}
It'd take more than a little{3}water to knock this old-{3}timer down!{1}No, it was the earthquake{3}afterward that made me{3}fall on my tush...{2}
Nobody believes me when{3}I tell them the continent{3}moved...{1}Why do you think I fell?{3}The ground shifts, you fall{3}on your fanny! It's a fact!{2}
I've always heard that the{3}Shrine of the Sea God holds{3}an amazing treasure...{2}
The dread pirate Briggs{3}was captured in Madra...{1}If that guy were free, you{3}could bet he'd be coming{3}after our village...{2}
Those two losers are{3}back home now, eating{3}their snacks...{2}
I thought I saw something{3}when those puddles dried.{3}Maybe it was just my eyes.{2}
So...I hear they caught{3}the pirate Briggs down{3}in Madra...{1}The seas should be safe{3}now. Makes me wish I still{3}had a boat...{2}
It was creepy{176}right before{3}the wave hit, the water{3}got all quiet and calm.{1}I don't know how to{3}explain it, but it was{3}really eerie.{2}
The puddles are gone,{3}and now I'm bored.{2}
I got hurt when I was{3}playing in the puddles,{3}so now I'm not.{2}
Thank our lucky stars{3}our little town survived{3}that ordeal.{2}
Is that guy still meeting{3}with the mayor?{2}
Those puddles stank!{3}I thought I'd get sick from{3}the smell of stagnant brine!{2}
I'm glad everything is back{3}to normal here in Daila...{2}
Nobody believes a wave{3}could be big enough to{3}move a continent...{1}I'm starting to think it's a{3}sign of things to come,{3}personally...{2}
I'd sure like to see what{3}that treasure is...{2}
I wonder what happened{3}to Briggs when they{3}caught him...{2}
Tavi and Riki must{3}have been starving. They{3}were gone for days...{2}
It's probably nothing but{3}junk and garbage, but it's{3}not my problem...{2}
The seas are peaceful and{3}free of pirates at last, and{3}I don't even have a boat.{1}Life's funny like that.{2}
Before the wave hit, the{3}tide went way out...{1}It was like the sea had{3}been drained away...{2}
I hope some of the little{3}puddles stay, at least.{2}
I caught my foot on{3}something that was in one{3}of those dried-up puddles.{2}
Let me tell you, kids{3}are a lot of work...{1}If they're not out getting{3}in trouble, they're inside,{3}and they're eating!{2}
Who stays outside until{3}he's absolutely famished?{1}And would it have hurt{3}to let us know where{3}he was going!?{2}
Mmm... Mmnph...{3}Dad was SO mad that{3}we were late...{1}He said, "No dinner for{3}you!" And I was like,{3}"Whatever!"{2}
Darn that Riki!{3}Ah... I'm glad he's{3}home, though...{1}He's so cute when{3}he's stuffing his face.{2}
Hee hee. My Riki is{3}mommy's little monster!{3}Just look how he eats!{2}
I still want to{3}catch that monster.{1}We are SO going back{3}there tomorrow.{2}
Our little one is{3}finally home.{1}I don't know where he{3}got to for all that time.{2}
Tavi wolfed down{3}his snack and just{3}asked for more!{1}He must think we're here{3}to feed him, I swear!{2}
Mmmph... Mmmm.{3}Don't tell anyone we were in{3}the Shrine of the Sea God.{2}
I guess Riki next door{3}made it home, too...{1}Those two are just{3}inseparable.{2}
Once Tavi finishes{3}eating, I'm putting him{3}right outside again!{2}
I'm sure glad I made it{3}down from that cliff...{1}I could have starved{3}up there!{2}
Are you going to Madra?{30}
You'll have to cross the{3}Dehkan Plateau...{1}It's a dangerous place.{3}You'll want to be very,{3}very careful out there.{2}
Walking into trouble just{3}for a boat ain't exactly{3}smart...{1}But sometimes, you have to{3}face danger to move forward.{2}
I think Madra is east of{3}the crossroads... I think...{2}
Daila got hit pretty hard.{3}I wonder how Madra is{3}doing...{2}
Someone should see{3}how the road to Madra{3}held up in the quake...{2}
{17}{5}...{2}
Well, well... Our happy{3}little family is back{3}together again.{2}
Alex...{3}Where did you go?{2}
To look for a ship,{3}of course.{2}
That's what Kraden said...{2}
And did you find one?{2}
Unfortunately, there are{3}none to be had.{2}
I spoke to the mayor, and{3}he suggested that we try{3}the large town south of us.{2}
Is that where you're going?{2}
Yes. Madra may have boats{3}available. That would be{3}the most logical move.{2}
So what do yout think?{3}Should we go to Madra{3}with Alex?{30}
Ah... You...want to{3}travel with me?{2}
What, you don't like{3}that idea?{2}
Ah. {17}{5} doesn't{3}think it's a good idea.{2}
You seem awfully{3}pleased about that...{2}
No, that's not it. I'm{3}just...preoccupied.{2}
Self-absorbed is more{3}like it!{2}
I simply prefer{3}to work alone.{2}
If that's the case,{3}we'll let you be...{2}
Perhaps you will see{3}me in Madra...{2}
Gah! The nerve of that guy!{2}
Yeah, I know... Now, I just{3}want to find a boat before{3}he does!{2}
Let's be on our way.{2}
Don't tell me you're all{3}looking for a boat, too!{30}
Look, there aren't any{3}boats here, not for you{3}or anyone!{1}Try Madra, down south!{2}
If I had one, I'd let you{3}use it, but I don't.{2}
It's too dangerous to{3}go to Madra now.{1}I wonder if that man who{3}wanted the boat will survive{3}on the Dehkan Plateau.{2}
Who was that guy?{3}I wonder why he needed{3}a boat so badly.{2}
Why did the pirate{3}Briggs plague us{3}for so long?{1}If I were going to Madra,{3}I'd go look him in the{3}eyes and ask him!{2}
He said he'd pay me{3}a fortune for a boat.{1}I'm not sure he'd pay{3}me even if I'd had one,{3}though...{2}
The road to Madra goes{3}through the Dehkan Plateau.{1}It's nearly impossible to{3}cross over that soft,{3}crumbly soil right now.{2}
Maybe that guy washed{3}up on shore when the{3}wave hit...{2}
Briggs probably has{3}lots of men under him...{1}If I lived in Madra, I'd be{3}more worried about them{3}coming to rescue him.{2}
Way back when, Daila used{3}to be a hideout for a band{3}of pirates...{1}They were all captured,{3}but no one ever found{3}their stolen treasure.{2}
This town may be dirt-{3}poor, but we still get a{3}good variety of travelers.{1}They're searching for{3}treasure, I'll bet. I hear{3}even Briggs was after it!{2}
We don't have a lot of{3}people in Daila, but it's{3}a very spacious town...{1}The layout confuses{3}me sometimes!{2}
Maybe they hid treasure{3}here because this town{3}is so mazelike...{2}
Tavi and Riki{3}are back home, safe{3}and sound...{1}They stopped by{3}to say hello on their{3}way... What nice kids.{2}
I hope their parents{3}didn't punish them too{3}severely...{1}They must have{3}worried their parents{3}half to death!{2}
Our fishermen still can't{3}head out to sea...{1}When will they start{3}fixing all those boats!?{2}
Oh, I was just practicing.{3}It's part of our dinner{3}show for guests...{1}You know, because we{3}don't actually have any{3}good food for dinner...{2}
Er... Aheh heh... You...{3}weren't watching, were you?{2}
I was just practicing{3}for the show we're putting{3}on tonight.{2}
When do we get to{3}sample some of Daila's{3}famous seafood?{2}
I'm sick of eating nothing{3}but vegetables... And the{3}service stinks!{1}At least there's a show.{3}I wonder what we'll see{3}tonight...{2}
Until we get our seafood{3}back, we have to put on{3}these shows for guests...{1}My feet hurt... I wonder{3}if they'll let me skip{3}tonight's performance...{2}
Shoot... What was my first{3}line? "Welcome to the Palace{3}of the Dragon King"?{2}
Putting on shows instead of{3}serving good food is fine,{3}I guess...{1}But won't stories about sea{3}dragons make people{3}think about seafood?{2}
I just hope they don't make{3}us watch another one of{3}those awful shows!{1}I'd rather eat a pile of{3}steamed cabbage than{3}watch them again!{2}
Maybe I'll just get up{3}on stage and do a little{3}dance of my own tonight.{2}
There is nothing left for{3}you in Daila...{1}Please be careful on{3}your journey to Madra.{2}
Daila's probably pretty{3}boring for travelers.{2}
Look...{3}It's Menardi's ship!{2}
It doesn't look like{3}they sailed here, though...{2}
Of course not...{3}They were killed at the{3}lighthouse, weren't they?{2}
Do you think it could{3}have drifted here?{30}
Yes, {17}{5},{3}That would be logical...{2}
How else could it have{3}come to be here, {17}{5}?{2}
If we had that thingie{3}Saturos had, we could{3}just take their boat.{2}
For all we know, the orb{3}is at the bottom of the{3}sea...with them...{2}
Well, there's no point{3}in hanging around here{3}all day.{2}
Let's go see about{3}finding ourselves a{3}ship we can use.{2}
We've been found!{2}
You wanna fight, punk?{2}
No one said anything{3}about fighting yet!{2}
We haven't done{3}anything to you!{2}
And if you think we{3}did, then prove it!{2}
I'm, uh, from Kibombo...{3}It's, er...nice to meet you.{2}
Hey, we're just here to{3}finish what you guys{3}started, OK?{1}You guys are the ones who{3}rammed into our continent,{3}and don't you forget it!{2}
Hey, we're just out here, uh...{3}camping... Yup. If you want{3}good camping, go to Indra.{1}We're just here to, you know,{3}see the sights and stuff.{2}
Our friends from Kibombo{3}are coming soon.{1}When they get here,{3}we'll all come say hello.{2}
Oh, tense... We're busted!{3}They're on to us, I know it!{1}We never should have{3}launched that raid on{3}Madra without the others!{2}
My family lost its entire{3}store of food{176}months'{3}worth, gone in a flash!{1}Well, we'll show those{3}foreigners what happens{3}when they mess with us!{2}
And once our Kibombo warriors{3}swarm over your town, we'll{3}all be real good friends...{2}
It was a good raid, but{3}after all that work, we{3}didn't find a thing...{1}I wonder what happened{3}to those people who fled{3}from the jail we broke into.{2}
The door is held closed{3}by a powerful force.{2}
Well, there's no point{3}in hanging around here{3}all day.{1}Let's go see about{3}finding ourselves a{3}ship we can use.{2}
You there!{3}Hold your ground!{2}
What seems to be{3}the trouble?{2}
Just wait there...{2}
They don't look like{3}they're Champa...{2}
I agree...{2}
Sorry for the delay.{3}You may pass.{2}
What were you{3}checking us for?{2}
Our town was sacked{3}by pirates...{2}
They'd come to free{3}their leader, Briggs.{2}
They came from the east,{3}a small party, and we{3}repelled them with ease...{2}
But then, foreigners struck{3}from the west, exploiting a{3}weak point near our prison.{2}
That's over now, though...{3}Feel free to relax and{3}enjoy your time here safely.{2}
There's no way those{3}pirates are coming back...{1}Not after Indra slammed{3}into Osenia. I hear you can{3}even walk there if you want.{2}
All of Indra shifted and{3}collided with Osenia...{3}Everyone's talking about it.{1}As if dealing with{3}invading pirate soldiers{3}wasn't enough!{2}
It's so weird that we can{3}just walk to Osenia now.{3}Crazy, crazy world...{2}
These are rough times...{3}We don't have nearly{3}enough people to help us.{2}
You comin' through here?{30}
Yeah, well...{5} We're workin'{3}in the hole right now, so...{1}Until we're done here,{3}you're gonna have to enter{3}Madra through the gates.{2}
That's good, 'cause we can't{3}let anyone through right now.{1}If you're goin' to Madra, you're{3}gonna have to go through{3}the front gates.{2}
The Champa dug this hole{3}when they raided our town,{3}but there's more to it...{1}The hole they dug uncovered{3}a cave that runs all the way{3}under our town!{2}
I can't believe the Champa{3}just stumbled onto this{3}cave accidentally...{1}That's like winning the{3}lottery or something!{2}
Who dug this cave?{5}{3}And why?{2}
The town elder took off{3}to deal with Briggs...{3}I wonder where he is now.{2}
You picked the wrong{3}time to come to Madra...{1}We've had disasters, pirate{3}attacks, all sorts of{3}nonsense...{2}
That big wave moved the{3}whole continent of Indra{3}to the south.{1}Now, we're sandwiched{3}between the two continents{3}of Gondowan and Osenia.{2}
Let me guess... You want{3}a boat, right?{1}Look, like I told that last{3}guy, the tidal wave went{3}and ruined all our boats!{2}
Maybe we'll learn Briggs's{3}whereabouts from that{3}captured Champa.{2}
If I could walk to Osenia,{3}I'd like to see Air's Rock,{3}out near Garoh.{2}
Did you come here over{3}the Dehkan Plateau?{1}Yeah? You must have{3}seen that boat grounded{3}near the cave, right?{30}
I hear it was a Champa{3}boat! And on it, they found{3}an unconscious Champa!{1}So they nabbed him, of{3}course, and they tossed{3}him in our jail!{2}
You didn't? Weird...{1}I wonder if it{3}drifted away...{2}
It's like all three{3}continents got together to{3}form a supercontinent!{2}
The Champa were swarming{3}over the village...{1}But I screamed like the{3}dickens and scared 'em{3}off! It's true! Heh!{2}
Those Champa curs dug a{3}hole here to sneak into{3}Madra...{1}And to think, it was just a{3}decoy so they could break into{3}the prison... What a crazy plan!{2}
I doubt the Champa could{3}have come up with that{3}plan on their own...{1}I'm not even sure that{3}strange boat we found up{3}north is even theirs...{2}
I got someone to show{3}me around inside... It's{3}just a really big hole.{1}Nobody could dig that much{3}in such a short time without{3}us noticing, you'd think...{2}
I don't care what the elder{3}says... That prisoner is{3}filthy Champa scum!{1}Until someone proves{3}otherwise, I say, let{3}him rot!{2}
We took that unconscious{3}guy from the boat and{3}tossed him in jail.{1}He keeps saying that{3}he's not Champa, though.{2}
My friend was on guard{3}duty when Briggs's{3}men attacked...{1}Who would let a menace{3}like Briggs go free?{2}
My partner was guarding{3}the prison...{1}When the Champa attacked,{3}he was so scared, he ran{3}off. Disgraceful!{2}
Everyone thinks Briggs{3}fled to the east after the{3}breakout...{1}I think that must be{3}where the elder went{3}with the others.{2}
The town elder is getting{3}pretty elderly. I hope he's{3}OK, traveling out there...{2}
If a big wave can move{3}the whole continent of{3}Indra...{1}Does that mean that all{3}of Indra is just floating{3}on the water?{2}
It's a bit of a problem that{3}the tidal wave destroyed{3}our boats...{1}But the tidal wave sort of{3}solved the problem, too...{1}Now, all three continents{3}are wedged together, and{3}we don't really need boats.{2}
That Champa in the cell{3}looks a bit pale for a{3}pirate...{1}I thought pirates were{3}supposed to be all tan{3}and leathery...{2}
I've always wanted to see{3}Air's Rock...but Garoh is{3}such a long way away...{2}
Who was it who told me the{3}Champa boat was damaged?{1}Doesn't matter... But I bet{3}Briggs went to Osenia{3}to find himself a new boat.{2}
Now, Madra is pinned{3}between two continents!{1}People from Gondowan{3}can walk here to visit!{3}What fun!{2}
When I saw those Champa,{3}I was so surprised that{3}I let out a yelp...{1}It must have startled{3}them, because they all{3}ran away!{2}
The Champa must have{3}known exactly where{3}Briggs was...{1}But how did they know{3}the layout of our town?{2}
It's not like the Champa{3}to plan out elaborate{3}strategies...{1}I think the two raids were{3}entirely coincidental.{2}
I'm not sure the Champa{3}actually dug this hole...{2}
I'll never forgive those{3}dogs for what they've{3}done to our village.{2}
I looked into that man's{3}eyes. He looked so serene,{3}so calm...{1}No one with such pretty{3}eyes could be a liar.{2}
I wonder how many{3}of the raiders were{3}actually Champa.{2}
I miss my partner...{3}It's a shame he turned{3}tail and ran like that...{1}But who knows? Maybe I{3}would have done the same{3}thing in his place...{2}
In all this chaos, everyone{3}here has clean forgotten{3}about Alhafra...{1}Sure, it's all the way in{3}Osenia, but they're bound{3}to have a boat or two.{2}
Madra and Alhafra, off in{3}Osenia, have a long{3}history together...{1}Alhafra's a thriving{3}seaport, up on the{3}northern coast.{2}
Wait a second... I'll bet{3}Briggs is heading to{3}Alhafra!{1}Of course! That'd be the{3}place to go if you were{3}looking for a boat!{2}
Alhafra has long been{3}a trade partner with Madra.{1}I should go there one day...{3}It's such an easy trip{3}from North Osenia...{2}
The lands to the south{3}of Gondowan are full of{3}barbarians, I'm told.{2}
Indra is in direct contact{3}with southern Gondowan...{3}Will we be safe?{30}
You're just trying to make{3}me feel better, but you{3}don't have a clue, do you?{2}
Listen, we don't need you{3}running around getting{3}folks worked up! Buzz off!{2}
The Kibombo are warlike,{3}but they live far off in the{3}center of Gondowan...{1}I can't imagine they'd{3}come all the way out{3}here...{2}
They say there are people{3}who use a frightening kind of{3}magic in Gondowan...{1}I don't know if it's{3}true, but it's absolutely{3}terrifying!{2}
A wave big enough to{3}move a continent is{3}a terrible portent...{1}Could the legendary{3}beast of the deep{3}have awakened?{2}
Everything happened so{3}suddenly... The earth moved,{3}and everything fell down...{1}It's going to take me{3}forever to clean up...{2}
If the mythical sea{3}creature has awakened,{3}we're all in trouble...{1}The legends say that only{3}one armed with an enchanted{3}trident can kill it.{2}
Everything's on the floor,{3}and all my dishes are{3}broken. What a chore!{2}
They say that boat belongs{3}to the Champa...{1}But I keep telling them,{3}that boat looks like no{3}Champa ship I've seen.{2}
The boat that ran aground{3}in the cove out east looks{3}like a normal ship, almost...{1}But I'm not sure a boat{3}like that can even sail.{2}
That boat's far sturdier{3}and far more sleek than{3}any Champa could build.{2}
It didn't even have{3}any oars! How does{3}it move? I don't get it.{2}
Milady and I have been{3}told to guard that{3}jewel on the mantel.{2}
Don't touch that gem!{3}The elder gave us strict{3}orders to protect it!{2}
My father was opposed to{3}arresting the man we{3}found on the boat...{1}But the townspeople were in{3}an uproar about the Champa,{3}and they locked him up...{2}
When the elder gets back,{3}I'm sure he will prove{3}that young man innocent.{2}
Dad and Grandpa have{3}gone to Osenia to look{3}for Briggs...{2}
Whenever Dad goes on{3}trips, he brings back{3}presents!{1}I wonder what he'll bring{3}back this time...{2}
I wish I knew why{3}the elder wanted us{3}to protect this thing...{2}
Until my father returns,{3}I'll protect this gem{3}with my life.{2}
He intends to find Briggs{3}and prove that young man's{3}innocence.{2}
If Dad has to fight,{3}I wonder if he'll go...{2}
I hope he brings me a{3}nice doll. I want a{3}wooden one!{2}
Admit it! You're one of{3}the Champa, aren't you,{3}{17}{8}?{2}
Speak! Or let your{3}silence condemn you!{2}
I told you already...{3}I'm not a Champa.{2}
Then where did you{3}come from?{2}
The heart of the Eastern{3}Sea... If I told you where,{3}you'd never believe me.{2}
Look at me when I'm{3}talking to you! Are you{3}trying to mock me!?{2}
I implore you, do not{3}anger me.{2}
Oh, do you? So what's{3}going to happen if I{3}make you angry?{2}
Hey, Shin...{3}Maybe you should go{3}easy on him...{2}
Hey, it wasn't your{3}girlfriend who got hurt!{2}
I'm sorry she was{3}injured, but I cannot{176}{2}
I don't want your sympathy,{3}freak! I want you to get{3}angry for me!{2}
Stop, please...{3}Even my patience{3}has its limits.{2}
Hey, don't you want{3}to see what he'll do?{2}
I think we should{3}just stop...{2}
If my words will not{3}cool your temper, then...{2}
Oh! That was Psynergy!{2}
Waaaaaaaaaahh!{2}
Did you do that?{2}
What did your friend{3}expect?{2}
You monster!{2}
I...{3}I am no monster.{2}
Help!!!{2}
This man... He must{3}be an Adept!{30}
Of course! That was{3}clearly Psynergy he{3}just used...{2}
You're right... We only{3}know what we just saw.{2}
Perhaps we should{3}try to learn a little{3}more about him.{2}
Ah... When will that kindly{3}elder return and end my{3}imprisonment?{1}I have no time to wait,{3}but I don't want to have{3}to hurt anyone...{2}
Why did I use my Psynergy{3}in anger? I must maintain{3}control...{1}My actions should{3}never cause regret{176}{2}
I...sense someone...{3}using Psynergy...{2}
That person...{3}Could he be{176}no, he is{3}not of my people...{2}
When will I be freed?{2}
Even if we tried to{3}tell someone what{3}we saw...{1}Who would believe us!?{3}I think I'll just guard him{3}from out here, where it's safe.{2}
Was I just dreaming{3}when that shaft of ice{3}appeared?{30}
Yeah! That's what it was...{3}It was all just a dream...{2}
What!?{5} Oh! Oh... You're just...{3}You're joking with me,{3}right? Yeah...joking...{2}
My sore bottom tells{3}me it was all real...{1}But I'm not about to{3}say that out loud...{2}
It was all just a dream...{3}If I keep on saying it,{3}maybe I'll believe it...{2}
After the Champa opened{3}the jail cells, they came{3}over here...{1}All of us merchants{3}grabbed our own swords{3}and started fighting...{2}
The item vendor got{3}wounded in the attack...{3}She's still recovering.{1}I don't think her boyfriend{3}will ever forgive that man{3}in the jail cell...{2}
Ow. Ow. Ow...{3}I think I got a bone{3}bruise. I hate those...{2}
Those lousy Champa...{1}Next time I see them,{3}they'll be the ones with{3}the bruises!{2}
My sister was hurt{3}when the Champa{3}attacked...{1}She's recovering, but I{3}sure hope Shin gets the{3}guy who did it.{2}
Ohh... {9}{4}Ohhh...{2}
Briggs and his men{3}are horrid. Imagine,{3}hitting a woman...{1}When I think about it,{3}I just get so angry!{2}
Eyes... Shining in the{3}darkness... No! Go away!!!{2}
Surely this town is{3}enduring some sort{3}of test...{1}We must not fail...{2}
We must pass this{3}test. Now is the time{3}to be strong!{1}Come, join hands, and{3}let us give thanks.{2}
A wave that moves the{3}very earth... This is no{3}act of man...{1}But certain forces do{3}move in mysterious ways...{2}
How could one explain{3}a continent moving?{1}Surely, it is the work{3}of a greater power...{2}
If this is a test,{3}please give us a sign.{1}We are your flock...{3}Do with us as you will...{2}
The raid was just another{3}part of the test. It must{3}have been.{2}
Has {17}{8} escaped!?{2}
Oh, I'm so relieved...{3}So {17}{8} hasn't escaped?{2}
If he had escaped, the{3}elder would no longer{3}be able to protect him.{2}
But...from the look of{3}things, it seems there{3}was a scuffle...{2}
The cell is in disarray...{2}
What happened in{3}there, I wonder?{2}
It seems {17}{8} is a man{3}of many mysteries.{2}
Not the least of which{3}being that boat he{3}arrived in...{2}
Oh, you there...{2}
You look like travelers.{2}
Milady, now is not the{3}time to be speaking{3}with strangers!{2}
It's all right... This one{3}has such kind eyes.{2}
When did you arrive?{3}And where are you going?{2}
My lady, please...{2}
Are you...going to Osenia?{30}
I knew it!{2}
No need to be{3}shy, my friends.{2}
One requires permission{3}to cross the bridge to{3}Osenia, correct?{2}
Then I hereby grant{3}my permission to these{3}four travelers!{2}
Relay that message{3}at once!{2}
You may all continue{3}your journey and cross{3}into Osenia.{2}
Father and the others set{3}out for Osenia to chase{3}Briggs... I hope he is well...{2}
Earthquakes, pirate{3}attacks... What a week!{2}
Our inn is quite safe...{3}The Champa themselves{3}couldn't fight their way in!{2}
I hope those Champa{3}don't come back for{3}a rematch...{2}
I slept right through{3}the pirate raid!{1}It's too bad, too. I would{3}have given those pirates{3}the thumping of a lifetime!{2}
I'm glad my partner and{3}I weren't injured when{3}the Champa attacked.{2}
The new land bridges{3}between the continents{3}should bring more business.{2}
Actually, I think it was{3}just that the Champa knew{3}we didn't have anything{1}worth stealing. I wonder{3}how they knew...{2}
No one was safe from{3}the Champa...not even{3}innocent women!{1}I should learn to{3}defend myself!{2}
I was hiding under my{3}bed the whole time...{1}But I'm not about to{3}tell him that!{2}
We were fine because{3}our karma is good.{1}Only people with bad{3}karma got hurt, I'll bet...{2}
If you wanna cross here,{3}you'll need permission{3}from the town elder!{2}
Without permission, ain't{3}no one's gonna cross this{3}bridge, no matter what!{2}
You goin' to Osenia?{30}
You'll have to head back to{3}town and get a permit!{1}Just go to the elder's house{3}and ask real nice-like.{2}
Then get lost, pal.{3}These parts can be{3}dangerous...{2}
If you have permission,{3}you can cross anytime.{1}But try to cross illegally,{3}and we'll throw you in the{3}hoosegow with Mr. Bluehair!{2}
I wish I could tell 'em{3}it's nothing personal...{3}It's for their own good.{1}Who knows what's{3}waiting to gobble 'em{3}up in Osenia!{2}
I'm startin' to wonder when{3}the elder and the others'll{3}come back from Osenia.{2}
Yeah, we heard about{3}you already.{1}If you're going to{3}Osenia, you'd better{3}get moving.{2}
Alhafra is up along the{3}northeast of Osenia...{3}You'll see it eventually.{2}
Head to Southeast{3}Osenia, and you'll{3}hit Mikasalla.{1}It's a small village, though.{3}Probably not much to{3}interest you there.{2}
If you try heading straight{3}through Osenia to Alhafra,{3}you'll hit Yampi Desert.{1}You'd be better off avoiding{3}the desert and just following{3}the coast to Alhafra instead.{2}
Unless I had a boat, I{3}wouldn't go to Osenia,{3}with permission or without.{2}
These guys must be looking{3}for trouble. Me, I'd rather{3}stay home and relax.{1}It's so pleasant and{3}comfortable.{5} And safe.{2}
This is a Champa boat...{3}You can see their mark{3}on the flag there.{1}They must have been{3}run aground here by the{3}tidal wave.{2}
Wait, if this is the Champa{3}ship, then that must mean{3}{17}{8} isn't a Champa!{1}So...why does the elder{3}still need Briggs to{3}clear his name?{2}
Look at all the damage...{3}That wave must have{3}been gigantic...{1}I wonder how many{3}Champa died in the{3}wreck...{2}
I guess even if they{3}did free Briggs...{1}They wouldn't have{3}been able to go back{3}out to sea...{2}
Briggs must be trying{3}to get a new ship in{3}Alhafra.{1}I hope the elder finds{3}him first!{2}
They still had enough{3}men to dig that hole{3}and attack Madra.{1}And enough to form{3}two attack parties, too...{2}
Look upon me with eyes{3}of truth... Then the door{3}will open...{2}
The door won't budge.{3}...Must be locked.{2}
It's been a long time{3}since we had any{3}visitors in Mikasalla.{2}
Are you looking{3}for someone?{30}
Well, if you're looking for{3}someone...{1}I'd say the best place{3}to start would be...{3}somewhere else.{2}
Didn't think so...{3}We don't get a lot of{3}strangers coming here.{2}
I went out to investigate{3}after the earthquake...{1}It looks like a whole{3}different land collided{3}into our own...{2}
If you're going deeper{3}into Osenia, you'd better{3}be ready for trouble.{2}
In the heart of Osenia{3}lies a sacred place,{3}Air's Rock...{2}
If you want to go into{3}the heart of Osenia,{3}there are two ways...{1}You can approach from the{3}south, or you can come{3}down from the north...{2}
If you look across the{3}ocean to the south,{3}you can see Tundaria.{2}
A town called Garoh{3}lies to the east of us...{1}But...its residents aren't{3}quite...human...{2}
Why would anyone travel{3}all this way just to come{3}to our backwater town?{2}
I like this time of year{3}best of all...{1}It's so much nicer and{3}more pleasant than the{3}harsh winter...{2}
Osenia was big already,{3}but now that we're{3}connected to Indra...{1}It's just huge!{2}
No way I'd leave town...{1}If I got lost on the roads{3}out there, I'd be a monster{3}snack in no time.{2}
Air's Rock has stood there since{3}this world was first formed...{1}Nobody knows exactly{3}what that means, though...{2}
It's weird that you can't{3}go all the way around{3}Osenia from the south...{1}I mean, it's a piece of{3}cake if you go around{3}from the north...{2}
It's bitter cold in{3}Tundaria... It snows{3}there all year long.{2}
The people in Garoh{3}are pretty furry.{1}They look weird{176}and{3}kinda cuddly{176}but{3}they're nice enough.{2}
I heard someone say{3}there's another continent{3}west of Gondowan.{1}...At least, that's what{3}my dad used to tell me,{3}rest his soul...{2}
My father-in-law was a{3}great explorer, long ago,{3}as was my husband.{2}
Hey, mister! Are you{3}an explorer?{30}
Awesome! Don't tell{3}anyone, but I want to be{3}an explorer too someday!{2}
My grandpa used to{3}travel all over the{3}whole world!{2}
It must be nice to get{3}out and see the world...{1}But staying in one place{3}is nice, too.{1}Maybe that's why my{3}dad founded this village.{2}
That boy sure admires{3}his grandpa, but I get{3}really worried about him.{1}I'm afraid he'd get hurt{3}if he became an explorer{3}like his grandfather.{2}
I love exploring out{3}behind the house...{3}It's my secret place!{2}
Buk buk buk...{2}
Bah! {9}{4}Baaaaaaa!{2}
The ground here is so{3}soft! I just want to{3}scratch and dig, buhKAWK!{2}
Oh, yeah! Mmm!{3}I just loves to eat{3}me some grass! Yum!{2}
Those who have climbed{3}Air's Rock claim that they{3}can see the unseeable...{2}
My husband has tried{3}to climb Air's Rock{3}many times...{1}I wish I knew what he{3}saw in that big hunk{3}of rock.{2}
What does the unseeable{3}even look like?{2}
I can't let him try to{3}climb it again. What{3}if he were injured?{2}
We only have a small{3}shop here. I used to{3}specialize in items...{1}But now, I sell armor{3}and weapons, too.{2}
I don't know much about{3}weapons and stuff...{1}I hope they don't ask me{3}any questions. Maybe{3}they only want items...{2}
There aren't any towns{3}between here and Garoh.{1}You should rest here and{3}maybe reequip yourselves{3}before heading out.{2}
You've come a long way,{3}friends. Stay a while, and{3}rest your feet.{2}
There's no reason to go{3}to Garoh unless you were{3}heading to Air's Rock...{2}
Why are travelers always{3}in such a hurry?{1}Like my mum used to{3}say, "Fools rush in..."{2}
Have you been{3}to Garoh?{30}
They're all werewolves{3}there... They hide away{3}from those who fear them.{1}But their cursed forms{3}come with great powers...{2}
Do not fear their outward{3}appearance...{1}Many revile them, but{3}they are gentle, and they{3}have kind hearts.{2}
I wonder if there are{3}werewolves beyond{3}those in Garoh...{1}I also wonder if they{3}might not be as gentle{3}as Garoh's folk.{2}
Forgive my manners...{2}
No, please...{3}Do not fear me.{2}
I am the warrior Galahad.{1}I am looking for someone,{3}and I need your help...{1}Do you know of a{3}knight called {17}{1}?{30}
You do? I must warn Sir{3}{17}{1} that he is in{3}danger most grievous...{1}Even now, Satrage,{3}Navampa, and Azart{3}are looking for him...{1}They wish to avenge{3}the loss he gave them{3}at Colosso.{2}
A pity... The one I seek{3}won a battle at Colosso,{3}in Tolbi.{1}He won...and too easily,{3}perhaps. Now, his opponents{3}are eager for revenge.{2}
I think {17}{1} must{3}be somewhere in the{3}Eastern Sea right now...{2}
{17}{1}'s enemies are{3}gathering now, to destroy{3}him and erase their shame.{2}
I fear what might happen{3}if the three find {17}{1}{3}before I can warn him...{2}
Gaaaroooooo!{2}
Aow-aow-oooo!!!{2}
What was that!?{2}
Awoooooo!!!{2}
Ah-ah-awoooo!!!{2}
Eeek!{2}
I don't believe it!{3}Was that a{176}{2}
A what? Kraden, do you{3}know what that thing was?{2}
Well... Perhaps...{2}
So, what are you{3}waiting for!? Tell us!{2}
I suspect it may have{3}been...a lycanthrope.{2}
A lycanthwhat?{2}
Just think of them as{3}a race of people born with{3}special powers...{2}
Kind of like Adepts,{3}you mean?{2}
Yes, that sounds right.{3}{17}{7}, you've put it{3}quite well.{2}
Adepts borrow their{3}abilities from the power{3}of the elements...{2}
While lycanthropes borrow{3}theirs from the power{3}of beasts...{2}
This is why they{3}take the forms of{3}animals...{2}
They may look{3}frightening...{1}But we must try to{3}communicate with them.{2}
Lycanthropes...{3}Werewolves... A whole{3}village in hiding...{2}
Is it just me...{1}Or does Kraden seem a{3}little TOO happy to have{3}found werewolves?{30}
What? Me? Happy to{3}find werewolves? You{3}must be joking!{2}
I would love to study{3}them, but still...they{3}do frighten me...{2}
I guess I'm just curious{3}about all of the secrets{3}of these new lands...{2}
Any real scholar would be{3}thrilled to explore a new land{3}full of mystery, huh?{2}
So, are there werewolves{3}only on Osenia?{2}
Ummm...{2}
If so, how could you{3}even have known about{3}them, Kraden?{2}
Er... I, uh...{2}
Yeah... That is weird.{2}
All right, so I lied!{2}
I'm glad we found{3}werewolves! There!{3}Are you happy!?{2}
And you know what!?{3}I even want to get a{3}closer look if I can!{2}
So let's go! Let's find{3}us some werewolves!{2}
So, uh...you say you{3}saw a werewolf?{30}
Don't be ridiculous...{3}There's no such{3}thing as werewolves!{2}
Of course not...{3}You should know there's{3}no such thing! Not here!{2}
Good evening. Forgive{3}me for not taking my{3}hood off...{1}I just...don't care much{3}for the full moon's light.{2}
Gaaaroooooo!{2}
Gah! Whoops...{2}
Heh heh hrrr...{3}I was just calling my{3}dog... Sounded good, huh?{2}
You there...{3}Strangers should not{3}go about at night...{1}Guests are welcome in{3}Garoh, but they'd do{3}well to stay in at night.{2}
Don't you love the{3}sight of the full moon?{30}
Yes, I agree...{3}But it brings me grief.{1}We here cannot{3}enjoy the sight{3}of it directly.{2}
Heh hrr hrrr... Don't feel{3}like you must watch your{3}words on my account.{1}The full moon's light gives{3}birth to many strange{3}sights on nights like this.{2}
It's grim luck that brings{3}strangers here in the{3}gloom of the full moon.{2}
Such gorgeous moonlight...{3}If only I could take{3}off this hood...{2}
Which one of us was it{3}who removed his hood in{3}front of these strangers?{2}
Foreigners only come{3}here en route to Air's Rock.{1}Only a chosen few{3}can reach the peak.{2}
The night of the full{3}moon is usually so{3}festive...{1}It's boring having to{3}wear these hoods{3}when strangers come...{2}
What!? Outsiders, here?{2}
Good evening, wanderers!{3}Are you looking for{3}something?{30}
Just...staying up late,{3}eh? Can't say I blame{3}you, on a night like this.{1}We here know the glory{3}of night of the full moon.{2}
Searching for{3}werewolves, eh?{30}
You don't really{3}believe they exist,{3}do you?{1}If so, you'd best keep{3}it to yourself...{1}That is, if you don't{3}want to have folks here{3}howling with laughter...{2}
Hehrrr... Sorry.{3}Just thought I'd ask.{1}We get some crazy folk{3}coming through here,{3}and I had to ask...{2}
Our oldest son is always{3}scampering off late{3}at night... Where is he?{2}
No fair! My brother{3}always gets to go{3}out late!{2}
Outsiders could never{3}understand the gift the{3}moon has given us...{2}
That pup of mine just{3}won't listen. He went out{3}when he shouldn't have...{1}He just wanted to see the{3}moonlight, and now his{3}father blames me for it!{2}
What made Master{3}Maha take my brother{3}into the rock?{1}I want to see{3}what's in there...{2}
Garoh exists to{3}protect Air's Rock.{1}In exchange, we gain{3}its power ourselves...{2}
So you've heard of Whirlwind?{3}Most people haven't...{1}Even in Garoh, only a{3}chosen few can use it.{2}
I've heard about the{3}Wind Stone...{1}Using Whirlwind on it{3}makes...something happen.{2}
We have other powers{3}than just Whirlwind...{1}I wonder which of us{3}will inherit the powers{3}of Master Maha?{2}
And different people use{3}Whirlwind different ways.{1}Master Maha's mastery{3}of Whirlwind would put{3}anyone to shame.{2}
I wish I knew what{3}would happen...{3}Something weird, I guess.{2}
When our people grow{3}older, they generate{3}strange powers...{1}Of course, I'm just a{3}wee pup, in people years...{2}
My mate is close to{3}obtaining the power{3}he's been seeking...{2}
I cast Whirlwind on the{3}stone, like I was{3}supposed to...{1}So why didn't I gain the{3}power that Maha wields?{2}
If he succeeds and carries{3}on Master Maha's traditions,{3}I'll be so proud...{2}
I'm sorry, but on nights{3}of the full moon, we only{3}sell claws and fangs.{1}You...probably wouldn't{3}have any use for those,{3}would you?{2}
I should be outside,{3}howling with the pack,{3}not stuck in here!{2}
Unfortunate that you{3}should come on a night{3}of the full moon, sir...{1}Come during the day{3}to see our full range{3}of wares...{2}
These strangers seem{3}normal enough...{1}Except that they're{3}up late for outsiders...{2}
Did you come here{3}from Alhafra?{30}
Really? You must have{3}gone through the cave...{1}You can't go back that{3}way, you know... The{3}return trip is longer.{2}
Oh, so you must have{3}come by way of Mikasalla.{1}If you're going to Air's{3}Rock, take the crossroads{3}west of Alhafra.{2}
I never change my stock,{3}unlike the weapons and{3}armor shopkeeps...{2}
A clear night around here{3}always means fair weather{3}on the morrow...{1}You've come all this{3}way, so you might as{3}well go to Air's Rock, too...{2}
Air's Rock can get quite{3}desolate. After all, it's in{3}the middle of a desert...{2}
Zzzz... Zzzz...{3}What a waste...{3}Just a big rock...{2}
Zzz... Whuzza? Whirlwind?{3}Wind Stone? Zzzzrrrgg...{2}
It only rains a few{3}times a year there...{1}Air's Rock is in a desert,{3}so what else would{3}you expect?{2}
Most people see nothing{3}of the true Air's Rock.{1}Our current guests{3}saw only the wind{3}and the dust...{2}
...Climbed all over{3}that stupid rock, and{3}for what? Nothing!{2}
That rock was huge.{3}How was I supposed{3}to make it spin?{2}
The people here may{3}be different, but they{3}certainly are nice...{1}And those abilities of{3}theirs are amazing!{2}
No matter what it takes,{3}I will save the souls of{3}those poor villagers...{2}
Haowooo!!!{2}
Aow-aow-oooo!!!{2}
Look! It's that werewolf!{2}
He was right there!{2}
Let's go find him,{3}{17}{5}!{2}
{17}{5}, wait...{2}
Where could that{3}werewolf have gone?{2}
Do you think we lost{3}him somewhere?{30}
That would be a shame...{2}
I hope we didn't...{3}Or rather, I'd be quite{3}unhappy if we did...{2}
Grrrr...{2}
What was that?{2}
It sounded like a wolf{3}growling, didn't it?{2}
My hearing is not{3}so very good, but...{3}there was something.{2}
Perhaps we should{3}search this area more{3}thoroughly...{2}
There is no need...{2}
Look... He's using Psynergy.{2}
Garrrrooow...{2}
Fear not...{3}This child is harmless.{2}
He does look kind{3}of...small...{2}
Grrrrrrr...{2}
Tell me, who are you? How{3}did you come to be here?{2}
I should like to ask you{3}the same question.{2}
Could it be? Do you{3}outsiders possess the{3}power to reveal the unseen?{30}
Impossible...{3}Without Reveal, you could{3}not have entered this cave.{2}
Of course... I was certain{3}that you must.{2}
Grawooo...{2}
Yes, you are correct. They{3}must have passed the{3}challenge of Air's Rock.{2}
Er... How come that kid{3}doesn't talk, like you?{2}
When we become werewolves,{3}speaking the human tongue{3}becomes more difficult.{2}
But you can... You must{3}be someone special, then...{2}
Hurh hurr hrrr... "Special"?{3}Perhaps.{5} Why don't you just{3}call me Maha...{2}
So... I assume you also{3}can use Whirlwind...{2}
If you learned Reveal on{3}Air's Rock, you must also{3}know Whirlwind.{30}
I don't think we need to hide{3}the fact that we're Adepts{3}from Maha...{2}
That's right...{3}I think we can tell Maha{3}that we're Adepts.{2}
Awooo...{2}
What did he say?{3}I don't understand...{2}
He wanted to know what{3}an Adept is... A question I{3}would like answered as well.{2}
Adepts tap the power of{3}elemental energies to generate{3}forces like Whirlwind...{2}
Elementals... You mean the{3}four elements, the powers of{3}earth and fire, water and wind?{2}
That is correct. These elements{3}together comprise everything{3}in our world...{2}
Interesting.{3}Very interesting...{2}
Awooo...{2}
Um... What did he{3}say that time?{2}
He asked if there were{3}no longer any need to hide{3}from you...{2}
...Why did he have to{3}hide in here in the{3}first place?{2}
Aaah-Ah-Awoooh!{3}Hawawoooh!{2}
No doubt, most would find{3}the sight of a werewolf{3}rather unnerving...{2}
You are, sadly, correct.{3}Many consider ours an{3}accursed race.{2}
And if they found you{3}in your werewolf form?{2}
...Once, our people were{3}burned at the stake as{3}abominations...{1}They called this{3}"purification."{2}
Horrible...{2}
But...this little one...{3}He won't get excited{3}and try to bite, will he?{2}
Child, return to{3}your home.{2}
Arrooo?{2}
Don't worry.{3}We can trust them...{3}Go back home now.{2}
Aarrrooo?{2}
They are Adepts, not unlike{3}us werewolves... They guard{3}an ancient secret.{2}
We can trust them. They{3}will not betray us to{3}the world.{2}
Woof.{2}
It has grown quite late.{2}
Why don't you go to{3}the inn and rest...{2}
But then...{2}
I will not leave{3}this place.{2}
You aren't going home?{2}
When I learned Reveal,{3}I lost my human form. The{3}wild is my home now.{2}
So, Master Maha, you{3}always look this way?{2}
And the little one?{2}
The child changed because{3}he looked directly at the{3}full moon.{2}
So, by tomorrow morning,{3}he will have returned{3}to his human form again?{2}
Correct.{3}Now, let us retire.{2}
I will tell the people of{3}Garoh that they need not{3}hide our secret from you.{2}
One who can master Reveal{3}in human form... An Adept...{3}What a remarkable thing...{2}
{17}{5} and party{3}stayed the night{3}at the inn.{2}
You folks didn't sleep much{3}last night... You don't look{3}like you got any rest at all.{2}
Master Maha told us all{3}about you. Don't you worry{3}about the bill. It's on us.{2}
Farewell, friends.{2}
I hear tell from Master{3}Maha that you guys are{3}special, too...{1}We don't have to hide{3}our secret from you{3}any longer!{2}
Last night when you saw{3}me, I was wearing a hood.{1}I guess I won't have to{3}do that anymore!{2}
Awoooooh!{2}
Heh heh... Sorry about that!{3}I'm so happy I don't have{3}to hide that I howled out loud!{2}
Maha said that you were the{3}only outsiders we could{3}share our secret with...{1}So...does it bother you that{3}we're all werewolves?{30}
Yeah, I thought so...{3}That's too bad.{1}I was so happy when Maha{3}told us. Now, I'm just{3}really disappointed. Arooo.{2}
Wow! You guys really are{3}different from the others!{1}Most people run away{3}screaming or even grab{3}their weapons...{2}
I heard there were other{3}werecreatures in Osenia,{3}in a few places...{1}...People who can turn{3}into other things than{3}wolves...{2}
Hey, it's you guys!{3}Thanks for last night!{2}
Oh, yeah... That's right...{3}You probably don't recognize{3}me in my human form!{2}
I was in the cave with Maha!{3}I was that little werewolf!{2}
I'm the reason you can{3}stay in our village and we{3}don't have to wear hoods!{2}
How could these outsiders{3}have learned Reveal?{1}These guys must be{3}pretty unusual.{2}
I thought we'd never be{3}able to talk to outsiders{3}about our secret...{1}I feel so free!{2}
I never thought I'd be{3}so happy to have our{3}secret out in the open!{2}
Maha said these travelers{3}were like us...{1}Does that mean they're{3}werewolves, too?{2}
I would love to meet{3}other werecreatures{3}someday.{2}
My dad told me I put the{3}whole village at risk...{3}He was really mad...{1}He said this whole thing{3}was just dumb luck... But{3}why would luck be dumb?{2}
Hey! It's you!{3}Thanks for looking out{3}for our son last night!{1}But I'm curious... Did you{3}believe in werewolves{3}before you came here?{2}
Everyone is amazed that{3}you learned Reveal{3}at Air's Rock!{1}If you have some time,{3}could you teach it{3}to our children?{2}
My brother should have{3}gotten in trouble, but they{3}barely even got mad at him!{2}
The younger the werewolf,{3}the less control he has{3}over his wolf form...{1}These travelers must have{3}been very brave to follow him.{2}
Oh, thank goodness!{3}Everything worked out,{3}and my husband's not mad...{2}
And dad said he was{3}really going to tan his hide{3}this time, too...{1}And now everyone's treating{3}him like he did some{3}amazingly good deed!{2}
So you're something special?{3}An Adept, or something like{3}that?{1}Does that mean that you{3}can turn into a wolf or,{3}something, like us?{2}
You learned Reveal at{3}Air's Rock and lived to{3}tell the tale...{1}So that must mean...{3}you can use Whirlwind.{2}
I just can't believe that{3}someone outside the{3}village learned Reveal...{2}
Did Maha mean that they{3}could change forms, like{3}we can?{2}
So these people can use{3}both Reveal and Whirlwind...{1}They must be powerful,{3}like Master Maha is.{2}
Normally, outsiders never{3}get in to see Maha, but{3}these people...{1}They can see him{3}whenever they want...{2}
You... Is it true that{3}you learned Reveal?{30}
Hmm...I thought Air's{3}Rock belonged to my{3}people alone...{1}But you young outsiders{3}have mastered it so quickly...{3}I might as well quit trying.{2}
No, I can tell it was you{3}they're talking about... I can{3}smell Air's Rock on you...{1}Ah, but you're so young!{3}And I am so very old...{3}I might as well quit trying.{2}
To think I've wasted so much of{3}my life on something you{3}did in a single afternoon...{2}
He's worked so hard...{3}But now, I don't know...{3}He seems so sad...{2}
I thought I could become a{3}leader if I learned Reveal.{3}How foolish of me.{2}
So now, even outsiders{3}are learning Reveal...{1}How do we decide who{3}will lead Garoh now?{2}
What do you think? I'll bet{3}these weapons suit you{3}better than any fangs would!{2}
I prefer the tooth and claw,{3}myself, but whatever...{2}
When we change form,{3}it's best to be unclothed.{1}But when you're human,{3}armor always comes in handy.{2}
Maha says that when we're{3}wolves, we don't need to{3}wear armor...{1}He says our instincts{3}will protect us.{2}
I've heard stories about{3}other mountains like our{3}own Air's Rock...{1}Like on this island that{3}lies across the Eastern{3}Sea, far from Osenia...{2}
I heard that one that's{3}across the Eastern Sea{3}is really pretty, too.{1}It's got water spilling down{3}the sides in huge torrents.{3}Sounds lovely...{2}
If you can pass the tests{3}of Air's Rock, you can do{3}anything!{2}
Maha came along{3}and said the nicest{3}things about you all.{2}
Those wolves were{3}really noisy last{3}night, too.{2}
Maybe we should stay{3}and try climbing Air's Rock{3}one more time.{2}
I've heard stories about{3}other places like Air's{3}Rock...{1}If they can handle Air's{3}Rock, they can probably{3}handle those too.{2}
He said if they were{3}werewolves, he'd want them{3}to take his place...{1}They must have made{3}quite an impression on{3}Maha for him to say that.{2}
I'm scared of wolves,{3}so I don't go out much{3}at night...{2}
If I used a lever, I{3}could probably make{3}that rock spin...{1}But I still don't get what{3}the point of it is...{2}
I've heard about you.{3}They say you're special,{3}like the people in this town.{2}
Am I the only one here{3}who isn't special!?{1}Please, won't somebody{3}answer my wishes and{3}make me special, too?{2}
Ah, you came...{2}
I've been waiting for you.{2}
Would you mind telling me a{3}little more about werewolves?{2}
You want to know the reason{3}we possess the power to{3}transform into beasts?{2}
Ah... Well, {5}I, er...{3}Actually, yes.{2}
Do you find it strange{3}that we can change our{3}shapes?{2}
Well, ummm... Yes.{2}
But surely changing one's{3}shape is not really all that{3}unusual.{2}
What are you getting at?{2}
Think about the caterpillar{3}for a moment.{1}When the time is right,{3}does it not transform into{3}a beautiful butterfly?{2}
Well, yes. It's only natural...{2}
And the pill bug and hedgehog?{3}Do they not change their{3}shapes to protect themselves?{2}
I have heard of these{3}creatures, yes...{2}
And many amphibians possess{3}the power to change color{3}at will, correct?{2}
In light of all this, do you{3}mean to tell me you find{3}werewolves so abnormal?{2}
Hrmm, well... To be honest,{3}I hadn't thought of it that{3}way before...{2}
Perhaps you simply did not{3}give it enough thought.{2}
How insulting! I, sir...{3}am a SCIENTIST!{2}
Indeed! A scientist?{3}That {9}{2}is{7} impressive.{2}
I have spent a great{3}deal of time thinking{3}about werewolves.{2}
For a time, I even felt{3}cursed to have been{3}born a werewolf...{2}
But after taking a more{3}objective look at nature...{2}
I realized that weaker{3}species have survived by{3}evolving...by transforming.{1}Don't you agree?{2}
Think about it for a moment.{3}Without changing their bodies{3}with weapons and armor...{1}Humans would be very{3}weak creatures indeed.{2}
I believe that evolving into{3}werewolves is just one way{3}for humanity to survive...{2}
But that's...{2}
Of course, there's{3}no way I can prove{3}this theory.{2}
But I felt that our ability{3}to use Whirlwind was{3}evidence of this.{2}
Whirlwind? Why?{2}
I had thought only the{3}people of Garoh could{3}use Whirlwind.{2}
It was a gift known{3}only to werewolves, to{3}Garoh's pack...{2}
And that only a chosen few{3}could use Reveal...{2}
But now I find that you,{3}too, can use these... What{3}does it all mean?{2}
Why are you able to use{3}Whirlwind, and what is{3}an Adept?{2}
Master Maha, do you know of{3}a continent called Angara? It{3}lies far north of the Eastern Sea.{2}
Angara?{2}
In the middle of Angara, there{3}is a peak called Mt. Aleph.{2}
Mt. Aleph? ...Then it's true!{3}Our legends say this peak has{3}stood since this world began!{2}
If Mt. Aleph does exist, then{3}perhaps our legends are true!{2}
It does exist...{2}
These two hail from the{3}village at the base of Mt. Aleph,{3}a village called Vale.{2}
They come from Mt. Aleph!?{3}Incredible!{2}
And they are both Adepts.{3}And while their powers{3}may vary...{1}Everyone from Vale is an{3}Adept to a certain degree.{2}
Then, does that not make{3}them like us in Garoh?{2}
In Vale, the myths say that{3}Mt. Aleph itself gave birth{3}to the Adepts...{2}
This is not what the legends{3}of Garoh tell us...{2}
As a people, they are{3}quite gifted...but it goes{3}far beyond that...{2}
The mystical stones on{3}Mt. Aleph... The Psynergy{3}Stones...{1}They are closely linked to{3}the powers of the townsfolk.{2}
"Psynergy Stones," you say?{2}
If there were similar stones{3}in Garoh, it might explain{3}your powers as well.{2}
And what manner of stones{3}are these Psynergy Stones?{2}
You've seen them, Maha!{3}The shining stone at the{3}heart of Air's Rock.{2}
I know the stone you{3}speak of, but...{2}
Air's Rock is quite far{3}from Garoh.{2}
I don't see how it could{3}affect the people here.{2}
I wonder... Could it be{3}the wind?{30}
You probably figured{3}it out for yourself already,{3}{17}{5}.{2}
I guess I couldn't have{3}expected you to understand,{3}{17}{5}...{2}
There were strong winds blowing{3}within Air's Rock... Those winds{3}would carry far...{2}
Carry? Carry what?{2}
Ugh! You're so dense!{3}The power of the Psynergy{3}Stone!{2}
How is that possible? How{3}could the stone's power{3}be carried on the wind?{2}
Do not belittle the{3}power of the wind!{2}
Given time, the wind can{3}grind great mountains down{3}to sand!{2}
I mean, the wind at Air's{3}Rock was strong enough{3}to blow us off the ground!{2}
So why couldn't the wind{3}carry particles of the stone{3}all the way to Garoh?{2}
She's right!
She's right!
Those particles from the{3}Psynergy Stone must be{3}charged with its power!{2}
This explains why your{3}Psynergy is weaker than{3}that of Vale's people...{1}You've been exposed{3}to smaller particles.{2}
The wind patterns might{3}also affect who among us{3}in Garoh can use Whirlwind.{2}
Of course, this is all mere{3}conjecture, but it does offer{3}us some clues...{2}
Thank you, umm...{2}
It's {17}{7}.{3}I'm pleased to meet you.{2}
Oh! Haven't we given you{3}our names, Master Maha?{2}
I am Kraden.{2}
This is {17}{6}...{2}
{17}{8}...{2}
And {17}{5}.{2}
You must permit me to thank{3}you for all you've done.{2}
No, no, please... We don't{3}need any thanks...{2}
That's too bad... I was{3}going to give you this.{2}
It's a Djinni!{2}
A "Djinni"? Is that{3}what you call them?{2}
When he is with you,{3}he adds to your power.{3}He is very helpful.{2}
I suppose you'll be continuing{3}your journey now?{30}
So you intend to travel by{3}sea? That is a long journey...{2}
So, you still can't tell just{3}what sort of journeys{3}await you...{2}
In that case, I think you{3}will get more use out of{3}this "Djinni" than I will.{2}
{18}{1} got the{3}Djinni {129}~.{2}
Another Djinni!{3}Talk about lucky!{2}
This is a great gift.{3}We are quite thankful.{2}
You don't need to thank{3}me. Just take care on{3}your travels.{2}
Good luck with the...{3}werewolf thing, Maha...{2}
Well, {17}{5}, we must{3}be going now.{2}
Take care in your{3}travels, {17}{5}.{2}
I wish that I were free{3}to travel the world, like{3}{17}{5} and his friends.{2}
{17}{5} checked the{3}tablet. It has strange{3}characters written on it.{1}Wielder of Wind's might...{3}Lay your hands upon this stone.{1}We bestow upon thee{3}the power to see the{3}truth unclouded...{2}
Do you think I ought{3}to touch it?{2}
{17}{7} touched the tablet.{2}
{17}{5} checked the{3}Psynergy Stone.{2}
Everyone's PP{3}was replenished!{2}
Beware the Wind Stones.{1}The stones magnify the power{3}of the wind. Use caution when{3}approaching Air's Rock.{2}
There's something inside{3}the cracked ice...{2}
We followed the pirates{3}here from Madra...{1}Are you going to{3}Alhafra, too?{30}
I don't think you can{3}get there through{3}the desert...{1}You probably should've{3}crossed the bridge you{3}passed on the way here.{2}
You guys are lucky. We've{3}gotta find some way{3}through this desert.{2}
If that accursed pirate Briggs{3}hadn't smashed the bridge,{3}we wouldn't be here!{1}Maybe we won't find him,{3}but I promise you {17}{8}{3}will pay the price for him!{2}
{9}{4}Ooooh...{7} This desert...{3}It's so hot out here!{3}I feel dizzy!{2}
Water... My throat is{3}so parched! *Gasp!*{3}...It's no use...{2}
Can't we just forget{3}about Briggs?{2}
No. I'm not about to{3}quit looking for him.{2}
There must be some{3}way through this desert!{3}We must press onward!{2}
As you can see, the{3}elder is quite insistent{3}on finding a way through.{1}He feels the only way{3}to Alhafra is through{3}this desert...{2}
This is where my son{3}must prove himself{3}as mayor...{1}So, Son. How are you{3}planning to get us{3}through this desert{1}and on to Alhafra?{2}
Father, how am I supposed{3}to get us through the{3}desert?{1}I think you're over-{3}estimating my abilities.{2}
Briggs and the Champa{3}are nowhere to be seen.{2}I wonder if they actually{3}made it to Alhafra...{2}
That {17}{8} is SO one of{3}the Champa... We don't need{3}Briggs to prove it.{1}When we get back home,{3}he's gonna pay for{3}helping Briggs.{2}
Sure, it's hot. But it's{3}a dry heat...{5}and{3}I can't stand it!{1}I want to go somewhere{3}cool and just relax!{2}
There's a spring over{3}there, but we can't{3}reach it...{1}I can hear Fate{3}mocking us.{2}
We've reached a{3}dead end...{1}I just want to go{3}home to Madra.{2}
My son is in quite{3}a fix, but I'm not{3}going to help him.{1}Only by overcoming{3}adversity can he ever{3}become a strong leader.{2}
My father's always telling{3}me to overcome adversity,{3}but he never tells me how!{1}I don't understand why{3}we can't just go home and{3}forget about Alhafra.{2}
Hey! Look! Up there!{2}
How did those guys{3}get up there?{2}
Maybe there's a path{3}up ahead that we{3}missed...{2}
Maybe... Maybe we can{3}get through the desert{3}after all!{2}
We can find a way{3}through to Alhafra!{2}
I don't care where we{3}go, as long as it's cool.{2}
Hey! I found it!{3}I found a way through!{2}
At last, we can get{3}through this accursed{3}desert!{1}Except that the elder{3}and the others need{3}to rest before we go.{2}
I was certain this was a{3}dead end. What's wrong{3}with this desert?{1}This is only delaying{3}{17}{8}'s punishment...{2}
I'm just glad we're{3}finally able to rest.{1}It doesn't feel like{3}my brain is on fire{3}anymore...{2}
Oh, man! This is the{3}best water I've ever{3}tasted! Yowza!{2}
Osenia is so much{3}larger than I'd thought...{1}I wonder how much{3}farther it is to Alhafra.{2}
My son...has passed his{3}first test as mayor.{1}I'll have to congratulate{3}him. Eventually. Now, to{3}see if his luck holds up.{2}
If we remain here much{3}longer, Briggs will be{3}beyond our reach...{1}We have to press on{3}just a little farther...{2}
Oh, not again!{3}Don't tell me they{3}want to rest again!{2}
My job is to find{3}evidence that {17}{8}{3}is a Champa.{1}The elder is with us,{3}so I wouldn't dream{3}of lying...{2}
Maybe we should have{3}the mayor go on ahead{3}while we rest here...{2}
I don't want to leave!{3}At least let me fill up{3}on water before we go.{2}
How much longer will{3}we be walking, anyway?{1}I feel like we've walked{3}off the edge of the{3}world as it is...{2}
Regardless of what{3}happens next, know that{3}you have done well, my son.{2}
Hooo... I can't believe{3}we're going to all this{3}trouble for a stranger...{1}I'm still not convinced that{3}{17}{8} isn't one of{3}Briggs's henchmen...{2}
North: Alhafra{3}South: Air's Rock{1}Warning: Beyond this{3}point, there is no{3}route back.{2}
Welcome to Alhafra. This is{3}the largest town in western{3}Osenia...{1}You can find anything you{3}need here! ...Unless you{3}need a boat, that is...{2}
A massive tidal wave{3}hit us and destroyed{3}every ship in Alhafra.{2}
I hear the tidal wave{3}knocked Indra into Osenia.{3}Is that true?{30}
Really? It's just so hard{3}to believe, you know?{1}Still, that would explain the{3}massive jolt we felt right{3}after the tidal wave hit.{2}
I was hoping a traveler like{3}you might have a better idea{3}of what happened... Oh well...{2}
I guess what those men{3}told me was true...{1}I'd figured they were just{3}playing a joke on me, so I{3}ignored them all...{2}
Right after my boat got crushed,{3}a group of men came by asking{3}if I had one for sale.{1}They were pretty swarthy,{3}like they might have been{3}sailors or something.{2}
This guy's probably wondering{3}about that boat sitting down{3}at the pier...{1}It still floats, but I don't{3}think the thing can move...{2}
Losing our boats was awful...{1}But I feel so bad for all the{3}people whose houses were{3}destroyed by the tidal wave.{2}
I just can't believe a single tidal{3}wave could cause an entire{3}continent to move like that.{1}But I used to be able to see{3}Indra to the north of us, and{3}it's definitely not there...{2}
Those guys looking for a{3}boat sure were in a hurry.{3}I wonder why...{1}Hey, at least I was able{3}to unload that boat with{3}the busted mast on them.{2}
Finally! We made it!{2}
We-We're here?{2}
Where's the Elder?{2}
He's coming now...{2}
Haaa hoo hooo...{3}Are we...here? I feel like{3}I just walked 500 miles.{2}
I'm fine... I feel like I{3}could walk 500 more!{2}
So...is this Alhafra?{2}
Madra's a pretty big place,{3}but this town is huge!{2}
We didn't come to Alhafra{3}to shop, Mister Mayor.{2}
We're here to bring in{3}Briggs the Champa.{2}
I know that!{2}
Then we should go{3}straight to speak with{3}Alhafra's mayor.{2}
We're in no shape to go{3}present ourselves to{3}the mayor right now!{2}
Look, Briggs is obviously{3}not here, and besides, we{3}already know {17}{8} is{176}{2}
Silence!{2}
It seems Alhafra has felt{3}the effects of the tidal{3}wave as well...{2}
It looks like they suffered{3}a good deal of damage...{2}
That would explain why{3}Alhafra doesn't seem to have{3}any boats for sale, either!{2}
You know, just looking around,{3}I get the impression they only{3}had one boat to begin with!{2}
So if you really needed a{3}boat, the only way to get{3}one would be to steal it.{1}Hmmm... But wouldn't that{3}cause quite an uproar?{2}
...Which means the pirates{3}must still be here, trying{3}to get a boat!{2}
So, you think we've actually{3}caught up with Briggs?{2}
No doubt about it!{2}
That's why I want to meet{3}the mayor of Alhafra before{3}the Champa steal a ship.{2}
Oh yeah... I get it now.{3}In that case, let's go see{3}Alhafra's mayor right away.{2}
Um... Say, excuse me...{2}
Where would we find the{3}mayor of Alhafra?{2}
Uh... The mayor?{2}
Just keep going down{3}this road. It's the last{3}house. You can't miss it.{2}
Those men didn't look like{3}they were from Osenia...{1}I wonder what business{3}they have in Alhafra...{2}
Those people that just{3}came through looked{3}totally exhausted.{1}You don't suppose they passed{3}through the Yampi Desert to get{3}here, do you?{2}
We've had a lot of{3}strangers coming{3}through here lately.{2}
Our port was ruined by the{3}tidal wave, so kids aren't{3}allowed there anymore...{1}But all I want to do is just{3}see what kind of wind is{3}blowing in off the sea...{2}
The only boat spared by the{3}tidal wave is that newfangled{3}ship that catches wind in a sail.{1}The thing is...the mast that{3}holds up the sail got snapped{3}apart!{2}
Let me guess... You're here{3}because you want to buy{3}a canoe, right?{30}
Sorry, but I'm totally backlogged{3}with preorders. I'm gonna be up{3}late finishing these as it is...{2}
That's good, because{3}I've got a ton of work{3}to do already...{1}And then I have to head{3}down to the wharf and{3}help clean up the wreck...{2}
That boat at the wharf uses{3}a sail, so it's more efficient{3}than any galley.{1}But since the mast is broken,{3}it's not going anywhere.{3}What a waste.{2}
Why would the mayor go and{3}sell our boat to a bunch of{3}foreigners?{1}I know it's got a broken{3}mast, but come on!{2}
...{2}
If this guy's looking to buy{3}a boat, he's looking in the{3}wrong town...{1}I already sold the last boat in{3}town, and it had a broken mast!{2}
Who would come to Alhafra{3}across the Yampi Desert? It's{3}way too dangerous!{1}Anyone with half a brain{3}would've just taken the{3}bridge to the northwest...{2}
This tidal wave's actually been{3}good for Alhafra. The town is{3}bustling with activity...{1}I think I'll steer clear of those{3}swarthy men at the wharf,{3}though... They're a scary lot!{2}
I don't know why they won't{3}let us kids go down to see{3}the dock...{1}I wanna see what kind of{3}damage the tidal wave did!{2}
I wonder if my partner has{3}finished up that canoe yet...{1}The sooner he finishes, the{3}sooner we can clean things{3}up down at the jetty.{2}
We can't raise the mast{3}until we get rid of the debris.{1}But I can't help get rid of{3}the debris until I finish at{3}least this one last canoe!{2}
I still can't believe those{3}guys wanted to buy my{3}busted boat! One man's junk...{2}
It may be newfangled, but{3}it's no good if it's broken.{1}Forget technology! I'm{3}sticking with boats with{3}oars! No masts for me!{2}
Ooo... This ain't good!{2}
That guy looked like the{3}mayor of Madra...{2}
He must have come here{3}looking for Briggs.{2}
I'd better go tell the others!{2}
What's your problem?{3}What are you, some{3}kind of freak?{2}
Well? What!? You got{3}a problem with me?{30}
Ah, who cares what you{3}think? I've got stuff to do,{3}so scram, kid!{2}
So where do you get off{3}invading my personal space,{3}huh? Scram, stinkbreath!{2}
Where was I? Oh yeah,{3}I was going to tell them{3}about the mayor of Madra!{2}
I don't care if it WAS broken!{3}The mayor shouldn't have up{3}and sold the town's only boat!{2}
Those guys who bought the{3}boat looked kinda shabby...{1}But I hear they paid the{3}mayor a whole wad of cash{3}for it...{2}
I wonder if the mayor{3}will use that money to{3}repair our poor town...{2}
Why would anyone pay so{3}much for a broken old boat?{1}I know I shouldn't be so{3}suspicious, but there's{3}something odd about them...{2}
We're taking care of some{3}people whose house was{3}destroyed by the tidal wave.{1}But...they're just so demanding!{3}My wife feels so overwhelmed{3}that she can't take it anymore!{2}
Augh! With all these demanding{3}houseguests, I feel like I've{3}lost control of my own house!{2}
Aren't you thirsty,{3}my dear?{2}
Oh, you're right, dear.{3}I am!{2}
Sorry to bother you, but{3}we'd like some tea.{2}
Are you talking to me?!{2}
If you want tea, you can go{3}right ahead and fix it yourself!{2}
Well! I say! It seems the lady{3}of the house is no lady at all!{2}
When we lost our house in the{3}tidal wave, the master of this{3}house offered his home to us.{1}But living with another family{3}isn't easy. Hahhh... They're{3}absolutely exhausting!{2}
I just wish that old man{3}would stop pestering my{3}wife all the time!{2}
I don't mind helping people{3}in need, but I won't be taken{3}advantage of...{2}
All I ask is for a little tea,{3}and that's the behavior I get!?{1}I just want to get out of this{3}inhospitable house and back{3}into my own sweet home...{2}
Is this how a young bride{3}treats her husband these{3}days?{1}Back in my day, we were{3}never like that!{2}
We were hit by a wave so{3}strong that it swept homes{3}off their foundations!{1}What's worse is, all my best{3}weapons were washed out{3}to sea!{2}
Losing all my most expensive{3}items may well ruin my business{3}entirely...{2}
That tidal wave may well wash{3}out both my business and the{3}weapon shopkeeper's!{2}
It doesn't matter how well-{3}crafted a suit of armor is... If{3}you soak it in seawater, it's junk.{1}All my furs are ruined... All my{3}steel is rusted. It's nothing but{3}garbage now...{2}
Don't mention the tidal wave{3}to the other merchants...{1}It did a lot of damage, and{3}we'd really just rather not{3}talk about it, you know?{2}
If all my goods were damaged{3}by seawater, they'd be useless.{3}I'd have to throw them all away...{1}I'm lucky the wave{3}missed my shop.{2}
Maybe you've noticed, but a lot{3}of folk here lost their homes in{3}the wave, but don't mind them.{2}
You see how full our inn is?{3}You'd think we'd be making{3}money hand over fist...{1}But that's not true... We just{3}don't have the heart to charge{3}the people who lost their homes.{2}
The town ought to give money{3}to all the people who suffered{3}from the tidal wave...{1}That way, maybe the innkeeper{3}could afford to make us{3}better food...{2}
I can't believe the innkeeper{3}is renting out more rooms{3}when we're as busy as this.{2}
The innkeeper told me to use{3}only the cheapest ingredients{3}to help save money.{2}
The innkeeper serves his{3}paying guests better meals{3}than we Alhafrans get.{1}That's so cheap! I want{3}gourmet meals, too!{2}
We're all guests in the same{3}inn, so why is my meal{3}so awful?{1}At the very least, they should{3}let us go back for seconds{3}of that stinking slop!{2}
Ohhh... I'm hungry...{3}My tummy hurts...{3}When's dinnertime?{2}
I don't think I've had a bite{3}of meat or fish ever since{3}setting foot in this inn.{2}
I'll never forgive the mayor{3}for failing to come to our aid{3}when we were all suffering...{1}I wonder what I can do to{3}make him suffer...{2}
Our guests are very upset{3}with the mayor. I just hope{3}they don't do anything...rash...{2}
My pop's been lookin' around,{3}an' he says the mayor keeps{3}all his treasure underground.{1}He says it's south of the{3}palace, but that's all{3}I know about it.{2}
Why do we all have{3}to be cooped up in{3}such a small room?{1}How am I supposed to sleep{3}with Grandpa grinding his{3}teeth all night?{2}
We all have to bear the{3}discomfort of this place until{3}our homes are repaired.{2}
I heard there's only one person{3}staying in the room next door.{1}Can't they just move one more{3}person into that room? Like me?{2}
So, you've finally come.{2}
I had suspected we might run{3}into each other again, since{3}we both are looking for boats.{2}
Unfortunately, the only boat{3}this town possesses has{3}already been sold.{2}
I will be resting here in Alhafra{3}a bit longer. I have traveled long{3}and hard, and I am weary.{2}
Perhaps we can get along{3}at least until we both depart.{2}
The broken mast on the{3}ship they sold won't be{3}easily fixed.{1}That is, as long as we Adepts{3}don't do anything about it.{2}
I never imagined anyone from{3}Alhafra would ever stay at{3}my inn.{2}
Perhaps the mayor will cover{3}the cost of lodging everyone so{3}we can feed them a decent meal.{1}We're just trying to be helpful,{3}but we're the ones who end up{3}looking cheap.{2}
I bet the master of the inn{3}could afford to give us better{3}food than he's been giving us.{2}
I can't believe the innkeeper{3}is cramming all those poor{3}people into that tiny room.{1}He certainly can't badmouth{3}the mayor...they're both stingy!{2}
I can't believe I'm only{3}supposed to feed the{3}villagers vegetable dishes.{2}
Maybe it's 'cause all we've{3}been eating is vegetables, but{3}I just never seem to fill up.{2}
I think I've lost weight from{3}all these vegetables!{1}Sure, I'm looking skinnier than{3}ever, but something tells me{3}this just isn't healthy.{2}
Maybe I'm just hungry, but{3}everything they put in front{3}of me looks delicious.{1}I'm so hungry I could eat{3}my own hand...{2}
*Sniff sniff*{3}That smell! That's the smell{3}of fish... No! Now I'm drooling!{2}
I hope the mayor's treasure{3}room doesn't run too close{3}to the prison...{1}If those thieves found out{3}about it, they'd dig their way{3}out in no time flat!{2}
I know our mayor's bad, but{3}he wouldn't stoop to stealing{3}from his own people, would he?{2}
Everyone says the hill beneath{3}the mayor's mansion is full of{3}tunnels. I wonder if that's true.{2}
I think they put me next to{3}Grandpa so they wouldn't have{3}to listen to him grind his teeth.{2}
When you're living packed in{3}together like this, you're bound{3}to get on each other's nerves.{1}I just hope everything goes{3}back to normal once we move{3}back into our own homes.{2}
That warrior next door{3}is so suave and handsome,{3}just how I like 'em.{1}I hope we can be friends.{2}
Really, I do wish you would{3}quit using your Mind Read{3}on me...{1}Trust me, my thoughts will{3}become all too clear in{3}due time...{2}
!{2}
In the middle of Osenia, there's{3}a terrible village where they{3}worship a foul and vengeful god.{2}
The people of Garoh brought{3}the curse upon themselves for{3}worshipping their wicked god...{2}
Everything's so boring here...{3}Why doesn't anybody do{3}anything...criminal?{2}
I don't know why there are so{3}many outsiders in Alhafra now,{3}but it's bound to mean trouble.{2}
Did you want to see the mayor?{30}
Sorry, but he's meeting with{3}some visitors from Madra{3}right now...{1}Maybe you can see him once{3}he's finished with them.{2}
The mayor is very open to{3}meeting visitors, but he's in{3}an important meeting now...{1}So it's probably good that{3}you're not here to see him...{2}
Listen, you look like an OK{3}guy, and I'd love to let you{3}through, but I just can't...{1}I mean, if I let you in, then I'd{3}have to let everyone in, right?{3}I'm sorry, but it wouldn't be fair.{2}
I hate my job. I always{3}have to be so tough and{3}secretive around people.{1}Deep down inside, all I{3}really want to do is read{3}them some of my poetry...{2}
My partner's always in such{3}a bad mood... Maybe I should{3}bake him a cake...{2}
No one is allowed beyond this point.{3}Don't even think about it.{2}
The mayor said no one goes{3}through, and I mean to make{3}sure no one goes through!{2}
It's... It's no use!{2}
The mast just won't budge,{3}no matter how many people{3}we get to help us!{2}
We're going to have to get{3}all this junk off the mast{3}first.{2}
If we could just get some{3}decent footing, we could have{3}this thing clear in no time!{2}
There's more to it than{3}that, though...{2}
We still have to do something{3}about that rope over there.{2}
Untangling that'll be a piece{3}of cake, once we get a boat{3}we can use...{2}
Oh, yeah... A piece of cake...{3}Except for that huge{3}rock over there!{2}
Oh yeah... The rock...{2}
How are we supposed to{3}get the mast out from{3}under that thing? It's huge!{2}
There's no way we're gonna{3}move it by ourselves...{2}
Well, either way, we can't{3}do anything until Zack{3}finishes the canoe.{2}
What's your problem?{2}
You're new in town,{3}aren't you?{30}
Well, I've never seen you{3}before, but whatever...{2}
You're probably curious{3}about this here ship, huh?{30}
Masted ships like this were{3}originally built by the Champa...{3}Oh, forget it. It's lost on you.{2}
They call this a "sailing"{3}ship... Wind is the only{3}thing that'll make it move...{1}Isn't that incredible?{30}
You kids today, with your{3}"been there, done that"{3}attitudes... It's a shame...{2}
Yeah, well, think how surprised{3}we were to find that Alhafra{3}had learned to build sailing ships!{1}I suppose the age when anyone{3}could sail the seas was{3}bound to come someday.{2}
We paid big money for this{3}ship. It's ours now, so don't{3}you go cryin' about it.{2}
We sent my pal into town{3}to get some supplies, but{3}he came back looking pale...{1}He went straight down{3}to talk to Briggs, and{3}I haven't seen him since...{2}
If we could just raise the{3}mast, we could head back{3}to Champa...{2}
People call us Champa a{3}seafaring people because{3}we make sailboats...{1}And sure, maybe we{3}do a little pillaging on{3}the side...{1}But now that Alhafra can{3}build sailboats, Briggs's{3}pirating days may be ending.{2}
I thought it would be easy{3}to right the mast, but I think{3}I must have been crazy...{2}
That lousy rat... If something{3}happened back there, he{3}should have told all of us!{1}Now I can't stop worrying...{3}What's taking him so long!?{2}
When I think about how long it{3}will be until we go home,{3}I miss Champa all the more.{1}I'm just glad nobody in{3}Champa knows we're pirates.{2}
The mayor of Madra? Here?{2}
You're certain?{2}
How did he know we{3}came to Alhafra?{2}
He knew we needed a ship,{3}and he knew we went east.{3}It seems pretty easy to me.{2}
Arr... Well, yeah... When you put{3}it that way, it does make sense...{2}
He was looking to find{3}the mayor of Alhafra...{2}
He must be hoping the mayor{3}will tell him where we are...{2}
He'll probably tell the Alhafrans{3}we're pirates, too, huh?{2}
Pirates!? That seems a{3}little unfair!{2}
What do you mean? We{5}.{5}.{5}.are{3}pirates, aren't we?{1}I mean, we've taken all sorts{3}of stuff that didn't belong to us.{2}
That's only because everyone in{3}Champa would starve otherwise!{3}We don't have any choice.{2}
Ah...{2}
And even then, it's never a lot.{2}
Wha-What's not?{2}
The stuff we take. We never{3}take too much from any one{3}town.{2}
Yeah, I guess not...{2}
And why do you think that is?{2}
Er... Why?{2}
Because you never can tell{3}how these wealthy towns will{3}react. It's too risky, right?{2}
Hey, yeah! Which is why we{3}didn't steal anything from{3}Alhafra...{2}
Right! That's why we avoid the{3}risky towns and just take what{3}we need from the others!{2}
See? That's why you're our{3}captain, Briggs! You've got{3}brains coming out your ears!{2}
Hmph! There's nothing{3}brainy about that!{2}
Did you hear that? It sounded{3}like a girl! Who's out there!?{2}
What do you think you're doing?{2}
Don't you know that someone{3}has been falsely imprisoned{3}for your crimes?{2}
Er... What's your point?{2}
You have to come with{3}us and attest to that{3}man's innocence!{2}
And...why would I want to{3}do something like that?{2}
Oh-ho! I was hoping we could{3}avoid any ugliness, but you{3}leave us no choice!{2}
We'll bring you in against your{3}will if we must, but either way,{3}you're coming with us!{2}
Isn't that right, {17}{5}?{30}
Good for you! Let's teach{3}these guys a lesson!{2}
After what they've done?{3}Come on, we need to{3}make them fess up!{2}
You don't stand a chance! We're{3}hardened criminal types! We eat{3}punks like you for breakfast!{2}
Watch yourselves, you self-{3}righteous little brats! You're{3}the ones with a lesson to learn!{2}
Well, that takes care of that!{2}
And I'm willing to bet everyone{3}Briggs has been harassing{3}will be quite happy to hear it!{2}
This should set everyone in{3}Indra at ease... They all seemed{3}to fear the pirate Briggs...{2}
We lost...{2}
Even pirates have honor...{3}I'll go quietly. I won't make a{3}scene just because I lost...{2}
Go on... Hand us over to{3}Madra or Alhafra or whoever...{2}
Good... First off, you can tell{3}the Madrans that the man called{3}{17}{8} is innocent.{2}
Fine. So, what, I just have to{3}say that {17}{8} isn't{3}one of my men?{30}
That's right. You tell the{3}Madrans that, and they can{3}release their prisoner.{2}
Saying {17}{8} is{3}innocent won't clear you{3}of your own crimes...{2}
We've secured Briggs's{3}vow... We should take him{3}to the Madrans...{2}
Wait!{2}
Can't you find it in your{3}hearts to forgive Briggs{3}and his men?{2}
And who are you?{2}
My name is Chaucha.{3}I am Briggs's wife.{2}
So you're a pirate, too?{2}
No! Chaucha hasn't done{3}a thing! Let her be!{2}
I know Briggs and his men{3}have caused some great{3}trouble with their piracy...{2}
And I know their crimes{3}cannot be ignored...{2}
If you know all that, then{3}how can you ask us just{3}to forgive him?{2}
The only reason Briggs{3}became a pirate was to help{3}the people of Champa.{2}
We Champa are a seafaring folk.{3}Our livelihood depends entirely{3}upon the sea.{2}
But in recent years, the sea{3}has changed... We can't live{3}the life we once could.{2}
The oceans have warmed, and{3}the fish have vanished from{3}our waters.{2}
The soil in Champa is rocky{3}and barren. No crops can{3}grow there.{2}
No crops? So you have no{3}grains? And no meat? It sounds{3}like life in Champa is hard...{2}
It's not hard! It's unbearable!{3}Our children can't eat! Our{3}village is dying!{2}
These men promised to return{3}with food enough for all our{3}people, but they found none...{2}
So you became pirates...thieves...{2}
We don't know where{3}Champa is...{2}
It sits on the southeast{3}corner of Angara...{2}
Southeast Angara? Isn't that{3}near Xian and Lama Temple?{2}
You have a good memory! If{3}you were to head south through{3}the mountains, you'd find it.{2}
That's so far away...{2}
Well, yeah! You think we{3}could be successful pirates{3}so close to home?{2}
If they raided any towns near{3}Champa, it would be obvious{3}to all who the attackers were...{2}
And no one back home could{3}forgive me if they knew.{3}Not even my grandmother...{2}
But where does that leave us?{3}Are we simply to accept your{3}looting here on Indra?{2}
I'm shocked, I tell you. Shocked!{2}
What's so shocking?{2}
It looks like they really{3}are pirates, just like you{3}said...{2}
Mister Mayor, I am appalled{3}that you could not take{3}our word for it!{2}
He probably wouldn't even{3}have believed we were from{3}Madra if the mayor hadn't come!{2}
Am I supposed to believe{3}the accusations of a{3}complete stranger?{2}
Is this your position, Mayor?{2}
How can I be expected to{3}believe a tidal wave could{3}wash Indra into Osenia?{2}
Or that a group of men{3}could walk{176}on foot!{176}from{3}Madra all the way to Alhafra?{2}
It sounds to me like you had{3}forgotten about us altogether!{2}
I'm not sure you remember{3}the last time we met. Do you?{2}
We met when I was just a child...{3}It must have been more than{3}ten years ago now...{2}
Twenty years! It's been twenty{3}years since I last saw you.{2}
Has it really been so long?{2}
It's been a long time indeed!{2}
I guess we can't blame you{3}for forgetting his face.{2}
Don't be silly! I didn't forget{3}his face! His face merely...{3}changed!{2}
Ahem! Forgive my interrupting{3}your interruption, but...{2}
Would I be correct in assuming{3}that I am speaking to the leaders{3}of Madra and Alhafra?{2}
You are correct!{3}I am the mayor of Madra.{2}
And I...
I am...
I am the mayor of Alhafra.{2}
I am Madra's town elder.{2}
And I am a close personal{3}friend of Shin, whose lover{3}was injured by the Champa!{2}
I am the scholar Kraden.{2}
He is {17}{5}, the{3}leader of our group.{2}
I am {17}{6}, {17}{5}'s{3}sister.{2}
I am called {17}{7}.{3}I come from the town{3}of Lalivero.{2}
Now, what errand has{3}brought you all here?{2}
We came for Briggs...
The mayor of Madra claims{176}
We followed Briggs here{3}from Madra.{2}
Of course, we have good{3}reason to suspect them{3}of being pirates.{2}
Ahem! And I was honestly{3}taken aback to hear a{3}businessman being slandered!{2}
If they truly are pirates, then{3}why would they go to the trouble{3}of buying a ship from us?{2}
Because the very funds they{3}used to purchase the ship{3}were pillaged from our homes!{2}
If the ship was bought with{3}Madran gold, then it belongs{3}to the Madrans!{2}
What do you say? If you give{3}them the ship, will that fix{3}everything?{2}
Then where will you go?{2}
I won't run, and I won't hide.{3}...Actually, I don't feel up for{3}much of anything right now.{2}
Then you probably won't mind{3}being locked up, will you?{2}
Briggs...{2}
Don't worry, Chaucha!{3}I'll be back!{2}
Take care of Eoleo!{2}
Your strange powers surprised{3}me, but even without them, you{3}would have overwhelmed us.{2}
We'll be taking that boat, then.{2}
You're taking our ship!? You're{3}worse than we ever were!{2}
Aren't you at least going{3}to pay us for the boat!?{2}
Quiet! All of you!{2}
Do as you must, but I{3}have one request...{2}
You have to let Chaucha and{3}Eoleo stay in the boat{3}until it's repaired.{2}
You haven't done Alhafra any{3}harm, Briggs...{2}
At least keep him locked up{3}until the boat is repaired...{2}
And our prisoner, {17}{8}...{3}Is he one of your men?{2}
I don't know any {17}{8}!{3}Sounds to me like you've{3}made a pretty big mistake!{2}
See! It's just as I said!{3}{17}{8} is innocent!{2}
You must return to Madra{3}and free him immediately!{2}
...Me? What, alone?!?{2}
Only two of us will remain{3}here. You can return to{3}Madra with the others.{2}
Understood! We'll return{3}immediately!{2}
Can you come with us?{3}...Please?{2}
It looks like that wraps{3}this whole mess up...{2}
Let us return to my mansion{3}for a nice cup of tea...{2}
You say your name{3}is Kraden?{2}
Thank you very much for{3}the help with Briggs.{2}
If you have the time, please{3}come see me at my mansion{3}before you go...{2}
It's nothing special, but I{3}would like to thank you for{3}everything you've done.{2}
Why do I get the feeling the{3}mayor of Alhafra prefers to{3}deal with my father over me?{2}
Thank all of you{3}very much.{2}
Due to your efforts,{3}{17}{8} is going{3}to be released.{2}
And now, this fine ship{3}belongs to Madra.{2}
None of this would have{3}come to pass were it not{3}for you. Thank you.{2}
Unfortunately, I don't have any{3}reward I can offer you here...{2}
Oh, pish posh! We don't need{3}any reward, do we,{3}{17}{5}?{30}
Ha! Your honesty is{3}refreshing, {17}{5}!{2}
That's as may be, but I still{3}feel quite indebted to you.{2}
So, what shall we do?{2}
I know... Come to Madra{3}after our boat has been{3}fixed and we've sailed home.{2}
We are still recovering from{3}the effects of the tidal wave,{3}so it won't be much...{1}But we do want to give{3}you some kind of reward.{2}
Well, shall we be going?{2}
I see, so...{2}
Oh! N-Nothing. Never mind...{2}
I do get to stay on the{3}boat, right? At least until{3}it's repaired?{2}
Yes. That's where I'll be if{3}you need me. ...With Eoleo...{2}
I feel kind of bad for Chaucha.{2}
What can we do about it?{3}After all, she's the one{3}married to a pirate.{2}
So, what should we do now?{2}
I suggest that we try to{3}find {17}{8}. He could{3}prove enlightening!{2}
That's true... He seems to{3}be a Water Adept.{1}He might be able to tell us{3}a little about these lands...{2}
Do you think we should{3}help them fix the boat?{2}
Say, if we help with the boat,{3}maybe they'll give us a ride{3}back to Madra! Good idea!{2}
What do you say, {17}{5}?{30}
All right! Let's go see{3}what we can do to get{3}this thing sailing again!{2}
You're opposed to it? Well,{3}since you seem to have your{3}own ideas, let's get going!{2}
Goo goo ga ga!{2}
Eoleo's only just recently{3}started doing that... After that{3}gem fell from the sky and hit him.{1}He was overcome by a{3}terrible fever, and when he{3}recovered, he had this power.{2}
Eoleo and I are going to{3}visit Briggs every day.{2}
I'm gonna use my magic{3}to free Papa.{2}
If Eoleo gets the hang{3}of it, then maybe Briggs can...{2}
We're all going to work together{3}to rebuild the homes that were{3}destroyed by the tidal wave.{1}It may have hurt us, but if{3}we put our backs into it, we{3}can overcome this hardship.{2}
Once things are back to{3}normal, we're all going to{3}build another sailboat.{1}If we all work together,{3}we'll have it done in no time!{2}
So, the guys who bought the{3}boat are the pirates who{3}were terrorizing Madra?{2}
Everyone is talking about{3}how you captured the pirates{3}in the prison.{1}Wow! Taking care of that{3}salty bunch is something else!{2}
The mayor is the only one from{3}Madra who stayed in town.{1}They said something about{3}freeing an innocent man...{2}
The mayor of Madra apparently{3}seized the boat from the pirates{3}and plans to sail it back home.{1}I think he's got quite a{3}wait in store before that{3}mast gets fixed.{2}
I never thought a fine house{3}could be crushed in the blink{3}of an eye by plain old water.{1}I guess that's what makes tidal{3}waves true natural disasters.{2}
I can help build houses,{3}too. ...At least for a little{3}while, right?{2}
We've put off fixing the boat{3}for now so we can work{3}on repairing the town first.{1}Which is exactly the{3}opposite of what the mayor{3}of Alhafra said would happen.{2}
Once repairs are done here,{3}we have to fix the bridge in{3}the northwest of Osenia.{1}I guess Briggs destroyed it.{3}If you're going that way, I'd{3}wait until the bridge is fixed.{2}
They told me they'd help{3}get that mast fixed up.{1}Would someone please explain{3}to me why suddenly they all{3}decided to fix houses instead?{2}
What does a sailor like{3}me know about building{3}houses, anyway?{2}
Hey! You there! Sailor boy!{3}Get back to work!{2}
Hey! Give me a break!{3}I'm on it!{2}
It's so nice of everyone{3}to chip in and help rebuild{3}Alhafra.{2}
Everyone in town is so much{3}happier now that we've started{3}rebuilding the town...{1}I hope things stay this nice{3}once all the work is done.{2}
You know, pirates who pay{3}for stuff instead of stealing{3}must be pretty weird pirates.{2}
Those pirates have{3}the coolest outfits!{1}Someday, I wanna be a{3}pirate, so I can dress{3}up all fancy like that!{2}
I can't believe they left{3}their mayor behind! Those{3}Madrans are so coldhearted.{2}
If our mayor thinks I'm going{3}to work on a boat for him,{3}he's got another think coming.{1}Madra's mayor can wait{3}here forever for all I care.{2}
You know, sitting here fixing{3}houses really makes you think{3}about how unsafe the sea is.{2}
Helping people out feels{3}really good.{2}
The fact that Madra took{3}our boat from us can't be{3}sitting well with the mayor.{1}That's probably why he{3}put off fixing their mast.{2}
I wonder if the crew from{3}Madra went back through{3}Yampi Desert...{1}If they weren't in such a{3}rush, they could just wait{3}for the bridge to be fixed.{2}
It's strange... The quarters{3}down in the belly of that{3}ship feel pretty cramped...{1}It seems like there should{3}be a lot more space down{3}there somewhere...{2}
Working on deck with the{3}cool ocean breeze on your{3}face feels great.{1}Working on land doesn't.{2}
I'm amazed those guys who{3}bought the ship were pirates...{1}But then again, they didn't{3}much look like your average,{3}run-of-the-mill merchants...{2}
I thought it was weird that{3}someone would pay that{3}much for a broken ship...{1}They probably had some{3}secret plan to steal from us...{3}That's why they were so quiet!{2}
Pirates? Here in Alhafra?{3}That's a scary thought. I'm{3}so glad they were caught!{2}
Those guys were just trying{3}to win our trust so they could{3}take advantage of us!{2}
We've all started working{3}together to repair the houses!{2}
Oooh... Not much longer, and{3}then I can kick these folks{3}out of my house!{2}
Once my old neighbors' house{3}is repaired, my life can finally{3}get back to normal.{2}
Once everyone started working{3}to rebuild the town, our hostess{3}started being much nicer.{2}
I wonder what happened{3}that's making the lady of the{3}house smile so much...{2}
Ahh... It's so relieving to see{3}my wife smiling again.{1}I don't think there will be{3}any more arguments with{3}our elderly guests...{2}
It won't be long until our{3}guests go back home...{1}It's a lot of work to help{3}a friend in need, but it does{3}feel good to be nice.{2}
The lady of this house is so{3}temperamental. She gets angry{3}at the smallest things...{1}It was just a little tomato{3}juice. How was I to know{3}that was her wedding gown?{2}
The lady of the house is{3}so adorable when she's{3}in a good mood.{1}It would be nice if she{3}were always in a good mood...{2}
Once they fix the old folks'{3}home, it'll be our turn to get{3}some repairs done.{1}We're all doing our part{3}to get things fixed, even if{3}it's just a little cleaning up.{2}
I was afraid my house{3}would never get repaired,{3}but everything's fine now.{1}With everyone working{3}together, maybe our new{3}houses will be a little sturdier.{2}
I'm so hungry I can't{3}even move...{2}
If we don't get out of{3}this inn soon, I'll die of{3}starvation!{1}The sooner Dad gets the{3}house fixed, the sooner I{3}get a good meal!{2}
You know, since we're rebuilding{3}the house, maybe I'll ask for{3}my own room!{2}
I wish someone would{3}just bring me some food...{2}
Thanks, mister.{2}
The kid ate the bread.{2}
Oh, wow, I feel so much better!{3}Look at how much energy{3}I've got now!{2}
Geez, mister, I don't know{3}how I can repay you...{2}
Wait, I've got it! Do you{3}like...adventures?{30}
Then you totally have to go{3}check out the caves under{3}the mayor's mansion!{1}Go find my dad... He's up{3}along the path near there.{3}The entrance is just past him.{2}
Really? Wow... You're so boring.{3}Well, if you change your{3}mind, just let me know.{2}
I'm feeling a lot better now{3}thanks to you, mister.{1}If you get any more food,{3}could you bring it to me, too?{2}
I wonder if I should have{3}shared some with my sister.{2}
All my neighbors are going{3}to work together to help{3}rebuild my house.{1}A friend in need really{3}is a friend indeed!{2}
Why, look at this!{2}
Wow, honey! You found{3}some gold coins!{2}
Way to go, Mom! So...{3}How much did you find?{2}
Oh! Well, it's not too much...{3}It's only 5 coins.{2}
That's great, though! We can{3}use it to buy some food!{2}
I'm going to start looking, too!{2}
What a stroke of luck! Right{3}when we really needed it, too!{1}There might be more, so{3}let's keep looking!{2}
I wonder if there's any more{3}money hidden around here...{1}Oh, and I'll help with{3}the cleaning up, too!{2}
My dad lost the draw, so{3}our house is going to be{3}the last one to get fixed...{2}
Losing the lottery and being{3}the last house to get fixed{3}takes some pretty bad luck.{1}At least no one is{3}complaining about how{3}bad our luck is...except me...{2}
I thought the hard part of{3}cleaning up would be fixing{3}the houses...{1}But that's a piece of cake{3}next to having to pick up{3}all these pots and jars...{2}
I really shouldn't be peeking{3}into other people's pots,{3}should I?{2}
All because of my dad's{3}stupid luck, our house is{3}the very last one fixed.{1}Maybe he can make up{3}for it by finding some cash.{2}
What? Briggs was the{3}leader of a crew of pirates?{3}Aw, but he was so nice!{2}
Briggs was very generous.{3}He bought plenty of weapons.{3}Wait a minute...{1}I wonder what he was{3}going to DO with all{3}those weapons...{2}
That group from Madra{3}was incredibly lucky!{1}They didn't do a thing, but{3}they get a great boat because{3}someone else caught Briggs.{2}
Getting a boat for nothing{3}seems like a pretty good{3}deal to me...{1}If you ignore the fact that{3}that boat isn't going{3}anywhere for a while.{2}
The Madrans dropped in{3}and stocked up on items.{1}I guess they're traveling by{3}way of Yampi, or they wouldn't{3}have needed so many supplies.{2}
The Madrans must have been{3}in quite a hurry...{1}They knew we were going{3}to fix the bridge pretty soon.{2}
As soon as I'm done{3}fixing up the inn, I'm going{3}to give a hand in town.{2}
We're all taking turns helping{3}out with the repairs in town.{1}The lady hasn't ever had to{3}work this hard before. I hope{3}she's going to be all right.{2}
Everyone's working so hard{3}to restore this town to its{3}previous splendor!{1}I've been working all{3}day, and I'm beat.{2}
There's still plenty of work{3}to do once all the construction{3}is finished...{1}It's going to be a long time{3}before these houses feel{3}livable again.{2}
Tonight's meal is chock-full{3}of ingredients to restore{3}strength and vitality.{1}Manual labor requires a lot{3}of energy, so you have to{3}rejuvinate with a good meal!{2}
Mom said we're gonna have{3}a bigger house than before.{3}I hope I get my own room.{2}
My son has terrible luck...{3}I think I passed my bad-luck{3}genes on to him...{1}At the very least, I hope{3}my grandchildren end up{3}with better luck than we had.{2}
The guy next to us is{3}awfully handsome. He's{3}just my type...{2}
So, I hear you{3}caught Briggs...{30}
{17}{4}, a young girl{3}from my clan, was very kind,{3}much like you are...{1}Perhaps you should consider{3}lending a hand to the mayor{3}of Madra. He could use it...{2}
You have no need to hide{3}such fine exploits from me.{1}Working hard for the benefit{3}of others is quite noble. That's{3}what {17}{4} always said...{2}
Why do I have to work so{3}hard? I'm tired, and I'm in{3}terrible shape for my age.{2}
I may not look very strong,{3}but I know I can help out.{3}I want to lend a hand.{2}
We heard a loud popping{3}sound when we tried to{3}hoist the mast...{1}We thought we'd broken{3}the mast, but it turns out{3}it was just my spine...{2}
I wonder what our new{3}houses will look like...{3}I can't wait to see them.{2}
I was told to use only the{3}cheapest ingredients, but{3}I actually bought only the best.{1}I don't think I'll be{3}telling the master of{3}the inn about this.{2}
Oh! If we get a bigger{3}house, we can get all{3}kinds of pets!{2}
I guess I just don't have{3}any faith in myself...{1}I should go with my instincts,{3}but I always change my{3}mind at the last second.{2}
Our neighbor is so mellow.{3}He never stresses out. Maybe{3}that's why he's so lucky.{2}
Feel free to help whomever{3}you like if it truly makes{3}you happy.{1}Perhaps capturing Briggs{3}marks the beginning of your{3}dreams coming to fruition.{2}
That cute boy next door{3}left already. What a shame.{2}
The fellow next door was so{3}handsome. He was just my type.{3}This one's not so bad either!{2}
Capturing the dreaded{3}Briggs was a great deed.{1}Allow me to thank you{3}on behalf of my townsfolk.{2}
I think this man might{3}even be able to defeat{3}the horrible werewolves...{2}
You here to see Briggs?{2}
Chaucha... It's good to see you.{2}
And you, too, Eoleo.{2}
Goo. Goo goo ga.{2}
How...is your cell? Is there{3}anything I can do to make{3}this easier on you?{2}
I'm fine, Chaucha.{3}My only complaint is that{3}the food here is terrible.{2}
What!? Are they forcing you{3}to eat this disgusting gruel?{2}
Now, wait a second...{2}
First of all, it's not disgusting.{3}It's nutritious! And besides...{2}
You're IN JAIL! What did{3}you expect, gourmet cuisine?{2}
Eoleo!{2}
Eoleo!{2}
Hooo...{2}
Ahhh waaah...{2}
{9}{2}WAHHH!{2}
I don't know why he's crying!{3}You're his mother! Can't you{3}do something?!{2}
There there, Eoleo...{3}What's the matter?{2}
Waa waa waa!{2}
Did the mean old guard{3}frighten you?{2}
Waa waa...{2}
Don't let him bother you...{3}He's just a big bully! Come{3}on! Let's get you home!{2}
Waa waa...{2}
We'll be back again later.{3}Will that be all right?{2}
Yeah, yeah. That's fine.{2}
We'll come back soon, dear.{2}
WAHHH!
I've been WAY too busy ever{3}since you captured Briggs{3}and his pirate crew.{2}
Oh, stopped by for a{3}visit, did you?{30}
I wish that I'd met you under{3}different circumstances...{1}If we had met out on the{3}open seas, you would have{3}seen a different man.{2}
Ah, so you just came here{3}to check up on us?{1}Hah! Well, as you can see,{3}we're not causing any trouble!{2}
I hate prison. The food is terrible...{1}My bed is hard and lumpy...{3}It's even worse than being{3}a pirate was.{2}
It sounds like the mayor of{3}Alhafra lost interest in fixing{3}that boat.{1}I guess that means it will{3}be a while before the mast{3}gets raised again.{2}
Everything would have been{3}fine if it hadn't been for{3}you meddling kids!{2}
I saw you staring at{3}Eoleo... But you couldn't{3}have figured out...{1}N-No! Of course not!{3}Nobody could see that.{2}
It's so boring here when{3}there's no one to guard. I'm{3}glad I've got some company.{2}
{17}{5} has strange{3}powers of his own, so we can't{3}let him see what Eoleo can do.{1}If he does, he might ruin our{3}only chance to escape...{2}
I'm not staying in this stupid{3}cell forever. I'll get outta{3}here one way or another!{2}
If they don't fix that{3}boat, then it's not going{3}anywhere.{1}I bet Alhafra's greedy mayor{3}doesn't like seeing Madra{3}profit from all of this.{2}
Oh, what's that punk {17}{5}{3}doing again? I wish that{3}troublemaker'd just scram!{2}
I hear some people can see{3}Eoleo's power... I want to see{3}for myself! How does he do it?{2}
Ah! {17}{5}! Welcome,{3}welcome...{1}Listen, sorry about all that{3}"not letting you in" business{3}before... Don't take it personally.{2}
Oh, {17}{5}! Go on in!{3}The mayor's been looking{3}forward to meeting with you.{2}
If I'd known Briggs was{3}a pirate, I would have{3}fought him myself.{1}I never get to have any fun.{2}
The mayor was really impressed{3}with these guys... He'll probably{3}want them to stay in Alhafra...{1}I hope he doesn't try to give{3}{17}{5} my job.{3}I hate when he does that.{2}
No one is allowed beyond this point.{3}Don't even think about it.{2}
The mayor said no one goes{3}through, and I mean to make{3}sure no one goes through!{2}
You're the one who gave my{3}son some food, aren't you?{1}Did you want to go{3}see the cave?{30}
If you were up for a little{3}spelunking, I'd be glad to{3}let you pass. Oh well...{2}
I'm only letting you pass{3}because you did good{3}by my son...{2}
I'm only letting you by so{3}you can explore a little.{1}Make sure you don't{3}lay a hand on any of{3}the mayor's treasure.{2}
I've heard that the deeper{3}you go into the cave, the more{3}dangerous it gets, so be wary.{2}
Not that it matters. The door to{3}the mayor's treasure room is{3}locked, so they're not getting in.{2}
You should go to the{3}watchtower and gaze{3}southward.{1}On a clear day you can see{3}the most amazing view of{3}Air's Rock from there.{2}
What do you think of Alhafra?{3}Have you taken a fancy to it?{30}
Then you are welcome to{3}stay here and relax for{3}as long as you please.{1}I am sure our mayor will{3}be happy to hear it.{2}
Then why don't you follow{3}your feet to the south?{1}There are plenty of delights{3}for warriors such as you in{3}the middle of Osenia.{2}
Our town was rife with{3}pirates until just recently.{1}Your efforts have removed{3}a scourge from our town. We{3}truly owe you our gratitude.{2}
The mountains to the east{3}of Alhafra are the Balloo{3}Range. They divide Osenia in two.{1}And we call the area on the{3}other side of the Balloo Range{3}East Osenia.{2}
There are numerous tales{3}about that rocky peak we{3}call Air's Rock.{1}Air's Rock looks so odd that{3}many people think there must{3}be something in hiding there.{2}
Why do they always tell me{3}to send adventure-seekers{3}to South Osenia?{1}All you do is go to the{3}desert and head south. Where's{3}the adventure in that?{2}
Those pirates never did us{3}any harm, but that's because{3}they were up to something.{2}
There's no way to cross the{3}Balloo Range from here.{1}I've heard western Osenia{3}is nothing compared to the{1}frightful things found{3}in the east.{2}
Lookee here!{3}Can't you see Air's{3}Rock out there?{30}
From here, it just looks like{3}a regular old rock, but from{3}up close, it's something else!{1}The first thing you think{3}when you see it is "Now{3}that's one serious rock!"{2}
Oh... I guess today is a bit{3}cloudier than usual.{1}Air's Rock has another name.{3}They call it the Windy Peak. You{3}almost never see clouds near it.{2}
The longer I sit here gazing{3}at Air's Rock, the more I grow{3}to love it.{1}All it takes is one glance,{3}and you're convinced it holds{3}some mystery deep within.{2}
I'd been saying Indra wasn't{3}in the right place for some{3}time now.{1}Nobody would believe me{3}until the mayor of Madra{3}actually walked here!{2}
I sat and gazed at that{3}continent every day.{1}I ought to know where that{3}continent should and{3}shouldn't be, I tell you!{2}
Are you the brave hero{3}who defeated the pirates?{30}
Well, I wonder if even{3}a hero like you can stand{3}up against a creature...{1}With the brains of man{3}and the strength and{3}cunning of a beast.{1}If you don't think any such{3}creatures exist, then head{3}south and see for yourself.{2}
I know you're the one who{3}beat the pirates... Don't try{3}to act humble...{1}You should have a little{3}more faith in your deeds.{2}
I heard the pirates talking{3}about the warriors who beat{3}them. They sounded tough.{2}
I wish someone would go do{3}something about that cursed{3}village south of us. It's evil...{2}
I hope the warriors who{3}defeated the pirates aren't{3}from Garoh, the cursed village.{2}
Darn that mayor...{2}
I thought he'd get that mast{3}fixed up for us right away...{2}
I'm starting to think the mayor{3}of Alhafra never planned on{3}repairing that boat at all!{1}I was a fool to believe{3}he would help us...{2}
He's already been paid to fix{3}the boat, but he says that was{3}only while it was Briggs's.{1}He probably expects us to{3}pay for the repairs a second{3}time... The greedy pig...{2}
If we leave the boat here and{3}go home, the mayor of Alhafra{3}keeps the boat AND the money.{1}There must be a way to fix{3}that boat without relying on{3}Alhafra's help...{2}
The money Briggs used to{3}pay for that boat was stolen{3}from our people...{1}I don't think it's wrong for us{3}to expect the mayor of Alhafra{3}to honor his promise.{2}
I'm sure the mayor has his{3}reasons for halting repairs{3}on the sailboat...{2}
The mayor feels that Madra{3}should only get back what was{3}stolen from them. Nothing more...{2}
But now, it seems the Madrans{3}are getting the better end of{3}the deal...{2}
The mayor thinks it unfair{3}that Madra should benefit{3}while Alhafra suffers.{2}
That's why he's keeping the{3}pirates' money and using it{3}to repair Alhafra, not the boat.{2}
If Madra wants their boat{3}fixed, then they can just{3}pay us to have it fixed.{2}
Briggs tells me there are{3}huge towns on a continent{3}that lies across the Eastern Sea.{2}
He tells me that, by trading{3}with one another, all of these{3}towns prosper and grow...{2}
I've made a decision... If Alhafra{3}is to prosper, then we must{3}trade, too! Trade and grow!{2}
I'm going to build an entire{3}trade fleet and make lots{3}of money!{2}
Still...there must be other{3}pirates and freebooters{3}still roaming the high seas.{2}
{17}{5}, Briggs told{3}me you and your friends{3}fought with great strength.{2}
If you could lend me that{3}strength, we would need{3}not fear any pirates.{2}
So if you'd just be willing{3}to help us out, our town could{3}begin trading...and prospering...{2}
What do you say?{3}Do we have a deal?{30}
Great! Why don't you just{3}stay here in Alhafra until we're{3}ready for our first trade run?{2}
Ah, such a pity that you{3}don't see the potential of{3}this partnership...{1}I certainly hope you will{3}reconsider... We stand to{3}make a lot of money...{2}
I am planning a glorious new{3}sailing ship so that we can{3}begin trading immediately...{1}I'm certain this will go well,{3}and we will both become{3}very, very wealthy indeed.{2}
The mayor won't help fix the{3}boat until he feels he's getting{3}a fair payment in exchange.{1}If Madra's mayor wants the{3}boat fixed, he's going to have{3}to shell out more cash.{2}
This is such a fantastic{3}idea, and I'm the one who{3}thought of it...{1}So, naturally, it need only be{3}me alone who profits from it.{2}
The mayor hates seeing anyone{3}else make money, so I'm sure{3}he'll make this tough on Madra.{1}Heh heh heh... The mayor{3}doesn't play fair.{2}
You do plan to help with{3}the mast, right?{2}
Not even Briggs and his{3}pirates could fix that mast.{3}How are we supposed to?{2}
They need our help... We{3}at least have to try...{2}
Isn't that right, {17}{5}?{2}
Well then, we'd better get{3}right to it, hadn't we?{2}
Are you finished here,{3}{17}{5}?{30}
Wait, you wanted to do this,{3}and now you're telling me{3}we should just give up?{2}
I just don't see how{3}much more help we{3}can be here, {17}{7}.{2}
Oh, don't be ridiculous! We've{3}already done so much.{2}
I know how you feel, but{3}there's nothing else we{3}can do right now.{2}
So... Maybe we should{3}start searching for{3}another ship then...{2}
...Not that I was planning on{3}"borrowing" the Madran's ship!{2}
Although...I did plan on asking{3}them if we could use it once{3}we got back to Madra...{2}
But it doesn't look like{3}the ship will be leaving{3}anytime soon.{2}
So I think maybe we should{3}just forget about that and start{3}on our way again, {17}{5}.{2}
It looks like the mayor of{3}Madra went home to fetch{3}some workers for the boat...{2}
I guess our mayor didn't even{3}offer Madra any help at all...{3}What a crummy thing to do.{2}
I hear the mayor of Madra{3}went back through the desert{3}and home to Madra...{2}
He seems like an honest,{3}hardworking young man...{3}nothing at all like our mayor.{2}
I don't know what we're{3}going to do about this{3}rock...{1}I think we've done all we can{3}do here... Let's get going...{2}
Hey! You lot! Hold{3}it right there!{2}
Hang on, there's no need to{3}stop them. They couldn't be{3}involved in this mess...{2}
If you're talking about the pirate{3}incident, I believe we resolved{3}that to everyone's satisfaction.{2}
This has nothing to do with the{3}Champa this time, old man! This{3}time, the Kibombo attacked us!{2}
"Old man"?!? Hmph!{2}
Wait... Did you say you were{3}attacked again? By the Kibombo?{2}
Do you know about{3}the Kibombo?{30}
You must be pretty worldly,{3}considering that they rarely{3}leave the heart of Gondowan.{2}
Not many people do... They're{3}a barbaric tribe from central{3}Gondowan! Watch out for them!{2}
When did all this happen?!{2}
Not too long ago...{2}
Right after the mayor{3}left, actually...{2}
It was them, wasn't{3}it, {17}{5}?{30}
Of course! They did seem to be{3}acting awfully strange when we{3}saw them in that cave...{2}
Surely you remember, {17}{5}!{3}The cave? Those strange men{3}we saw in there?{2}
Was anything stolen?{2}
Only a single black orb...{3}Everything else was untouched.{2}
A black orb...{2}
I'm afraid we don't have much{3}more information than that.{2}
You helped us with the Champa,{3}so, I'll tell you what...{1}Maybe you could look around{3}at the mayor's house. It's the{3}only one that was robbed.{2}
First, pirates raid our town,{3}then the Kibombo come{3}storming in...{1}Things have been going{3}horribly for Madra lately...{2}
My guess is the Kibombo{3}have long since fled the{3}area.{1}Still, considering the way things{3}have been going, we still want{3}to have guards at the gates.{2}
The way things have been{3}going, I'm so scared I can{3}hardly sleep at night...{1}Is there no way to appease{3}the gods? Is our town cursed?{2}
I've been standing for so{3}long, I wish they would give us{3}little stools we could sit on.{2}
Oh, uh... You coming through?{30}
Yeah, uh... We're sealing the{3}hole up right now, so you, uh,{3}can't get through this way.{1}If you're trying to get into{3}Madra, why don't you head{3}around to the main entrance?{2}
Yeah, well, that's good, 'cause{3}we wouldn't let you down here{3}anyway...{1}Besides, anyone who's going{3}to Madra can just go through{3}the main gates, like normal folk.{2}
We sealed up the hole, but{3}nobody seems to feel any{3}better...{1}Maybe we should just fill up{3}the catacombs completely...{2}
We think the Kibombo came{3}into Indra across the new{3}land bridge...{1}But just because they {9}{2}could{7}{3}attack Madra doesn't mean{3}they had to...{2}
So... The Kibombo got into{3}Madra from Gondowan, right?{1}Well, doesn't that mean that{3}we can cross into Gondowan{3}from Madra, too?{2}
The Kibombo came in through{3}the broken wall to the west.{2}
I heard that the elder got{3}us a boat in Alhafra...{3}I wonder if that's true...{2}
I guess that guy we had{3}in prison wasn't one of{3}Briggs's cronies after all...{2}
Gondowan sounds like a{3}frightening place. I don't{3}think I'll ever go there.{2}
Hey, mister! Are you the guy{3}who beat up Briggs?{30}
So does that mean you'll{3}go thump the Kibombo, too?{2}
You're not? Someone told{3}me it was a young warrior...{3}That sounded a bit like you.{2}
I can't believe someone{3}stomped on those pirates...{3}That's incredible!{2}
Now that we're sealing off the{3}other end of this hole, maybe we{3}won't have any more surprises!{2}
There are still plenty of{3}things I want to investigate{3}in this cave.{1}And until I do, there's no way I'm{3}going to seal the entire thing off.{2}
Briggs didn't have nearly{3}as many pirates under him{3}as we thought he did.{1}He did an amazing job of{3}flanking the town, considering{3}how few men he had.{2}
These caves were my{3}secret hiding place.{1}I wish they weren't going{3}to seal it all up.{2}
That guy {17}{8} wasn't{3}one of Briggs's men{3}after all.{1}I can't believe we locked him{3}up without any evidence...{2}
Oh, {17}{8}? We released{3}him as soon as we heard.{1}He stopped by the mayor's{3}house and then left town.{2}
Everyone yelled at me for{3}running away this last time,{3}so next time, I'm gonna fight!{1}But the thing is, last time,{3}I took such a beating I got{3}lumps on my head. Ouch!{2}
You shoulda seen my partner{3}in that fight!{1}He was in the mix right up{3}until they took him down...{3}Man... That takes courage!{2}
If it weren't for that tidal{3}wave, none of this awful stuff{3}would have happened...{2}
If Gondowan is really that{3}much bigger than Indra,{3}then I should go check it out.{2}
It's strange... It's almost as{3}though the Kibombo knew that{3}the wall was broken...{1}But there's no way they{3}could have known...unless{3}the pirates told them...{2}
The mayor is supposed to be{3}coming back with that boat...{3}I wonder when that will be...{2}
He told us he was innocent,{3}but we jailed him anyway. Is{3}that justice? Is that right?{2}
In Gondowan, they have{3}evil magic curses they can{3}put on you in an instant!{2}
I heard the guys who captured{3}Briggs were just a bunch of{3}feeble-looking kids...{2}
If they were strong enough{3}to beat Briggs, they must{3}be huge!{2}
It was so convenient, being{3}able to sneak out through{3}the cave to the other side.{2}
I wonder who dug those{3}underground passages{3}and why they're there...{2}
Wait, if Briggs only has four{3}crew members, then they{3}couldn't have outflanked us...{1}They must have had help{3}from someone else...{2}
I've never seen any{3}monsters around the{3}cave entrance...{1}I want to go inside and see{3}if there are any monsters{3}inside, but I can't...{2}
{17}{8} didn't seem like{3}he was in a very good{3}mood when he left town.{1}I guess he was still angry about{3}having been imprisoned like that.{2}
{17}{8} was so happy{3}to get out of jail...{1}But after he spoke to the{3}mayor's wife, he looked unhappy.{3}I wonder what she told him.{2}
I didn't have a chance to{3}run away during the fight. The{3}Kibombo were everywhere!{1}That's the only reason I stayed{3}to fight them. But I'm not about{3}to tell anyone that!{2}
I can't believe nobody seems{3}impressed that my partner{3}fought the Kibombo so bravely.{1}Don't tell me they don't think{3}it takes guts to stand up{3}against them, because it does!{2}
So Briggs and his pirates{3}must have gone to Alhafra{3}looking for a boat.{1}I'm impressed that they{3}were captured before{3}they could escape.{2}
It was sure sneaky of Briggs{3}to destroy the bridge to{3}Osenia after they crossed.{1}It made it really hard for{3}the mayor to reach Alhafra.{2}
Now that Briggs has{3}been captured, I have{3}nothing to fear!{1}Yes! That means I can head{3}to Osenia for some business!{2}
It sounds like Osenia is a{3}huge place. They took forever{3}to catch up with Briggs!{2}
The Kibombo are a very{3}warlike tribe.{1}That last attack was enough{3}to warn me to stay away{3}from central Gondowan!{2}
I'm glad the Kibombo's attack{3}wasn't too terrible this time,{3}but what if they come back?{2}
Our best guess is that the{3}Kibombo come from the{3}central part of Gondowan...{1}Why would they turn around{3}so quickly after coming all{3}this way?{2}
What can we do to stop the{3}Kibombo from attacking us{3}again?{1}Maybe we have to find a way{3}to separate our continents,{3}like before the tidal wave...{2}
The Kibombo apparently used{3}ropes to climb down the cliffs.{1}But we can't climb back up{3}the cliffs from this side.{2}
My husband pursued the{3}Kibombo after the attack,{3}but he had to turn back...{2}
If I were just a little bit younger,{3}I think I might have been able{3}to catch those Kibombo.{2}
In his youth, my husband was{3}a very fast runner. They called{3}him "The Cheetah."{1}I guess he's learned that he{3}can't race against old age.{2}
{17}{8} left that boat{3}of his behind when he took off...{1}That thing wasn't going{3}anywhere, so I guess he had{3}no choice but to give up.{2}
I can't stop thinking about{3}that ship {17}{8} left{3}by the eastern shore.{2}
Some people in town saw{3}{17}{8} heading toward{3}the Gondowan cliffs.{2}
I wonder if that ship grounded{3}by the eastern shore is still{3}broken.{1}It seems like a well-built{3}ship. It'd be a shame to{3}just leave it there...{2}
All the Kibombo wanted when{3}they attacked was the black orb{3}that sat above the fireplace.{1}We're just lucky{3}no one was hurt.{2}
My father was holding on to{3}that orb for {17}{8}, and{3}the Kibombo stole it...{1}No matter how much he{3}apologizes for losing it,{3}it won't make things right.{2}
{17}{8} went to Kibombo{3}to get his orb back.{1}We told him that central{3}Gondowan is very dangerous,{3}but he wouldn't listen.{2}
If my father'd been in town,{3}I wouldn't have been scared{3}when the Kibombo attacked.{2}
My father hasn't come home yet,{3}even though Briggs has{3}been captured.{1}I'm scared that something{3}happened to him...{2}
When my husband hears that{3}the orb he was keeping was{3}stolen, he'll be quite angry...{2}
I won't ever forget the look{3}on {17}{8}'s face when he{3}heard his orb was stolen.{1}He was so sad... It was like{3}he'd lost a part of himself...{2}
When {17}{8} left, he said{3}he was going to pursue the{3}Kibombo, but I wonder...{1}What if he reached the cliffs{3}and then couldn't climb them.{3}I hope he's not stuck...{2}
Dad always knows what to{3}do... He'd never have let those{3}Kibombo barge in here...{2}
I hope he's just late because{3}he's looking for a good{3}souvenir to bring me...{2}
{17}{8} wasn't one of{3}the Champa... That's{3}why they let him go.{1}You shouldn't just keep an{3}innocent man in prison for{3}no reason.{2}
So, that {17}{8} guy{3}wasn't a pirate after all, huh?{1}That still doesn't answer{3}where that ice came from...{3}That freaked me out...{2}
There was something really{3}frightening about {17}{8}...{3}I'm glad to be rid of him...{1}He went after the Kibombo,{3}but I doubt he'll make it{3}back from Gondowan alive.{2}
That {17}{8} was a{3}strange fellow.{1}Shin was terrified of him.{3}He let him go as soon as we{3}learned he was innocent.{2}
The armorer and I are busy{3}researching the equipment{3}the Kibombo left behind.{1}They dropped a lot of strange{3}weapons that might reveal{3}more about the attacks...{2}
The Champa weapons we found{3}before are identical to the{3}Kibombo weapons we just found.{1}It can't be a coincidence...{2}
I knew there was something{3}strange about the pirates{3}attacking us like that...{1}I think those weapons we{3}found are going to be the{3}key to the mystery...{2}
The group that attacked from{3}the east used different weapons{3}from the group to the west.{1}If they really were from the{3}same crew, then why would{3}they use different weapons?{2}
All my injuries have healed{3}up pretty nicely...{1}It made for a nice vacation,{3}but now, it's time to get back{3}to work.{2}
I'm so happy that my sister's{3}all better now.{2}
That Shin is always bugging{3}me just to relax and take{3}a break. He's a real pain.{1}I like working more than{3}I like sleeping.{2}
I was so scared that my{3}sister wouldn't get better...{3}What would I do without her?{2}
The Kibombo are a tribe from{3}Gondowan... They're searching{3}for some great and evil power.{1}Do not allow yourselves to{3}be corrupted by them.{2}
If that tidal wave hadn't hit{3}us, the Kibombo would never{3}have been able to attack.{2}
Them Kibombo possess{3}{9}{4}evil powers.{7} They sure{3}are a weird bunch.{2}
I hope the power of our faith{3}will prevent the Kibombo{3}from attacking us again...{2}
Everyone says them Kibombo{3}were mostly nekkid...{3}They sound so...savage!{2}
We're lucky the Kibombo didn't{3}use their evil powers... There{3}were enough injuries as it was.{2}
I've heard that the Kibombo{3}wield an evil, wicked magic...{1}But...why didn't they use any{3}of it when they attacked us?{2}
Things have been busy here...{3}First, the pirates, then the{3}Kibombo... What a week!{2}
I hid under my bed on{3}the night of the attack.{3}I was really scared!{2}
I watched the entire attack of{3}the Kibombo with my own eyes.{1}I'll never forget it... I was{3}paralyzed with fear...{2}
If you want to know about{3}the attack, talk to my partner.{3}He saw the whole thing.{2}
There's nothing worse than{3}wicked, evil magic. I don't want{3}to see it, much less use it.{2}
If it were me, I would have{3}attacked a wealthier town.{3}...If it were me.{2}
After I crawled under the{3}bed, I fell asleep, so I was{3}pretty achy the next morning.{2}
I had to go to the bathroom in{3}the middle of the night, but{3}when I went...{1}I saw all these eyes in the{3}darkness. I got so scared...{3}I didn't have to go anymore.{2}
The Kibombo attacked in the{3}wee hours of the morning...{1}Why weren't they asleep, like{3}all us respectable people?{2}
Is the way clear?{2}
This area is clear! The strange{3}one has not been seen!{2}
And there?{2}
We have not seen the{3}stranger near the village.{2}
Do you believe he was truly{3}headed toward Kibombo?{2}
The guards here were only{3}recently knocked unconscious.{2}
Correct. We were under orders{3}to maintain a strict watch{3}over the mountain pass.{2}
No one must be permitted into{3}Kibombo until Akafubu has{3}completed his ceremony.{2}
Then we had better hurry to{3}find the one who attacked{3}our guards.{2}
Keep a good watch. Do not{3}permit anyone to pass.{2}
If anyone interrupts Akafubu's{3}ceremony, he will hold you{3}responsible...{2}
Guards! An intruder!{2}
Someone is trying to{3}pass! To arms, Kibombo{3}warriors! To arms!{2}
Here! The intruder is here!{2}
Kibombo does not{3}permit visitors!{2}
You just follow this road right{3}back to where you came from!{2}
Guard! Get him out of here!{2}
{9}{4}Grrrrr...{7} Rrrruff!!!{2}
Ah-roooo! Ah-roooo!{3}HAWOOOO!!!!{2}
Outsiders are not allowed{3}to enter Kibombo. Begone!{2}
Grrrrr!{3}Rrrruff! Rrufff!{2}
An intruder! Repel the intruder{3}immediately!{2}
Hey! Who's there!? Get{3}me out of this crate!{2}
Sniff sniff...{3}Lick lick lick!!{2}
It's dark! It's cramped!{3}Somebody get me out!{2}
A bone! That's my favruff!{3}Lick lick... It's deruffcious!{2}
This rock is in my way.{3}I want to get to the other side.{2}
Rrruff! Rrruff!{2}
Dig here, you dig? Rrruff!{2}
I knew it! I knew there was{3}something there, and he{3}dug it up! Look at that!{2}
I tried to go to Gondowan to{3}find my fellow tribesmen, but{3}the ropes were taken down.{1}I can't go back to Kibombo{3}until someone realizes that{3}I'm missing and comes for me.{2}
I wonder who removed the{3}rope from the other side...{2}
If the other warriors knew we{3}could not return to Kibombo,{3}they would be distraught.{2}
I long to see my homeland{3}again. This Indra lacks the{3}savage beauty of Gondowan.{2}
{17}{5}! Where do you{3}intend to go?{1}We should try to help{3}{17}{8} recover his{3}black orb.{2}
Kraden's right. I think we should{3}try to help {17}{8}, too.{2}
I completely agree{3}with Kraden and {17}{6}.{2}
It looks like the majority wins!{3}Let's go back to Kibombo{3}and help {17}{8}!{2}
Welcome to Naribwe.{3}It's really hot out...{3}You should relax a while.{2}
The Kibombo went on an{3}expedition to the east, but{3}they've already returned.{1}Do you know what kind of{3}expedition it was?{30}
What? They crossed over to{3}Indra and attacked a town!?{1}The Kibombo are a reckless{3}and dangerous people.{2}
Oh, you don't? The Kibombo{3}rarely journey far abroad.{3}It's very worrisome...{2}
The Kibombo never move in{3}such large numbers without{3}orders from Akafubu...{1}Without that witch doctor,{3}the Kibombo would be a{3}much more peaceful tribe...{2}
I would not venture far north{3}of here if I were you...{2}
It's been dangerous out ever{3}since the day the gems fell{3}from the sky.{1}After that day, all local{3}creatures suddenly grew{3}more powerful and terrifying.{2}
When Oeia was their witch{3}doctor, the Kibombo were much{3}more peaceful.{1}Akafubu took over when Oeia{3}passed on, and he is responsible{3}for their warlike ways.{2}
Can you tell me where you{3}have come from?{30}
Angara? That is a land far to{3}the north, is it not?{1}I've heard that when it is hot{3}here, it is cold in Angara.{3}The world is a strange place.{2}
Why won't you tell me?{3}What are you trying to hide?{2}
It's always hot here in Naribwe.{3}It doesn't matter if it's summer,{3}winter, or spring. It's always hot.{2}
You don't plan on going to{3}Kibombo, do you, mister?{30}
Well, you'll have to find a path{3}through the Kibombo Mountains{3}to get there.{1}The Kibombo warriors keep{3}a close watch on the pass.{3}They won't let you through.{2}
That's a wise choice. Nothing{3}good would come to you in{3}a place like that.{2}
On the far side of the river{3}lies a huge mountain we call{3}Magma Rock.{1}It is a sacred place that{3}the gods created long ago.{2}
I can hardly stand the heat{3}in Naribwe, and I've lived here{3}my whole life!{1}I can't imagine what travelers{3}must think of it.{2}
Akafubu is almost certainly{3}looking for jewels.{1}I cannot understand{3}why a witch doctor{3}needs so many jewels.{2}
It is awful to the north of{3}Naribwe... It is hotter, and{3}the creatures are fierce...{1}And worst of all, that's{3}where the Kibombo are!{2}
That was the day the wind{3}blew so hard and the dark{3}clouds came from the north.{1}That's when those strange{3}gems fell from above.{2}
Kibombo magic was once{3}widely respected. Now, it{3}is merely feared.{1}That is the way of things{3}since Oeia appointed Akafubu{3}as his successor before dying.{2}
The warrior who passed through{3}here earlier said he came from{3}an isle in the middle of the sea.{2}
To get to Kibombo, you have{3}to cross over the Kibombo{3}Mountains.{1}I seem to recall my{3}grandfather telling me about{3}a way past the guards.{2}
Sometimes, you can hear{3}explosions from across the{3}river near Magma Rock.{1}I wonder what's going on{3}over there.{2}
When I climbed the Kibombo{3}Mountains, I had to find a path{3}the Kibombo didn't know about...{2}
I remember when I found that{3}path above the pass... Not even{3}the Kibombo knew about it!{1}I'm not even sure I could{3}find the way to the higher{3}pass anymore...{2}
The fortune-teller lives{3}at the highest house in{3}Naribwe...{1}He's the closest thing{3}we have to a mayor.{2}
We're a small village, but if{3}we all cooperate, we can get{3}almost anything done.{2}
The fortune-teller in Naribwe{3}has quite a reputation...{3}His predictions are so accurate!{1}He's always done them for us{3}alone, so I don't understand{3}how he got so famous.{2}
As long as we listen to the{3}words of the fortune-teller,{3}we won't have any worries...{2}
If you desire a reading,{3}stand before the table...{2}
{17}{5} placed {20}{2}{3}on the table.{2}
I am a teller of fortunes.{3}Would you have a reading?{30}
Then stand back.{2}
It costs 20 coins to hear{3}what your future holds.{3}Will you pay?{30}
Then away with you.{2}
Many want things they cannot{3}afford. If you do not have the{3}money, you will have no reading.{2}
Very well. Show me one{3}of your items.{2}
Are you prepared?{30}
{17}{5} changed his mind{3}and took back the item.{2}
Shall I give you another{3}reading for a different item?{30}
Then away with you.{2}
I shall begin my reading...{2}
I see...{2}
Beyond the weapon you set{3}down lies a terrible foe.{2}
Many enemies await you, far{3}beyond the mountains.{1}If you move to strike{3}them... you will meet{3}with great disaster.{2}
In a misty sea, a mighty foe...{3}A fiersome battle awaits you.{1}Gather the pieces of the{3}weapon to defeat him, or{3}drown in defeat yourself.{2}
None in the eastern world{3}can stand against the power{3}you possess.{2}
I feel a shining power glowing{3}beyond the item before me.{2}
You are lost in your way...{3}Another continent needs{3}your attention, another land.{1}A towering rock amid a{3}sea of sand. Return there{3}and find your way again.{2}
A distant isle lies far to{3}the northeast... Sail there.{1}High atop a rocky peak, a{3}power awaits you...{2}
I see a paradise awaiting{3}you... An island in the east.{1}But even paradise must have{3}its trials... Scale the peak and{3}earn your power.{2}
A tiny figure stands against{3}a wasteland wrought in snow...{3}The southern edge of the world.{1}It is you... In the icy plains,{3}you will find ancient ruins{3}and ancient power.{2}
I see you lost in mists, lost{3}in time, lost in the seas...{1}And there, I see you gaining{3}an ancient, fearsome power.{2}
The eastern lands hold{3}little for you now. You will{3}not remain here long...{1}I see you opening a channel{3}between the continents and{3}sailing the Western Sea!{2}
Beyond the item before me,{3}I see a path for you to follow.{2}
I see you inside a sacred icon.{3}By listening to the voices,{3}you will earn a precious item.{2}
You must forge a weapon to{3}defeat a mortal enemy.{3}Seek out the pieces!{2}
You will raise a mighty column{3}and gain assistance where it{3}is least expected.{2}
You will gain tremendous help{3}from a village on the eastern{3}reaches of the northern lands.{1}Seek them out.{2}
You have the weapon you{3}need to defeat the sea beast.{1}Go to the sea of mists{3}and face your foe!{2}
The object that you seek lies{3}somewhere in the west.{1}Why do you linger in the{3}eastern world? If your work is{3}done, the west beckons you.{2}
The object you have placed{3}before me wields a mighty{3}power over a terrible foe.{2}
Near the beach where you{3}washed ashore lie ancient{3}ruins. Seek them out.{2}
In the northern reaches of{3}the Eastern Sea lie moss-{3}covered, overgrown ruins.{1}You should explore them.{2}
In the distant south lies an icy{3}cape. Above the rocky shore{3}stands a tower. Climb it.{2}
You have the weapon you{3}need in many fragments..{1}Bring them to the people at{3}the eastern edge of the{3}northern continent.{2}
That object you have placed{3}before me... It is a fearsome{3}weapon to a particular beast.{2}
If you wield this weapon, you{3}can defeat the legendary beast!{2}
But there are no more beasts{3}for you to fear in this part{3}of the world.{2}
From the garb you have{3}placed before me, I sense the{3}presence of the one you await.{2}
To the east lies a continent{3}moved from its foundation. The{3}one you seek waits in the wood.{2}
To the north...inside the sacred{3}icon, the one you seek awaits.{2}
To the north...beneath the{3}sacred icon...the one you{3}seek awaits.{2}
Head east by southeast... In a{3}cave on the southernmost{3}continent in the Eastern Sea...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
Head east by northeast... In a{3}cave on a tiny islet, the{3}one you seek awaits.{2}
Head north by northwest... In a{3}forest on the northernmost{3}continent in the Western Sea...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
To the northwest...in the ruins{3}on the southern continent{3}in the Western Sea...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
Head west by northwest... In an{3}inlet on the southern continent{3}in the Western Sea...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
To the north...in the village{3}that knows no spring...{3}the one you seek awaits.{2}
Head east by southeast... In{3}the desert on the southern{3}land in the Eastern Sea...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
Head east by northeast... In a{3}cave on the continent that{3}shifted from its foundations...{1}The one you seek awaits...{2}
To the southeast...in the{3}plains of the southern continent{3}in the Eastern Sea...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
To the south...in the forest...{3}the one you seek awaits.{2}
To the east...beside the{3}boulder on the tiny islet...{3}the one you seek awaits.{2}
Head east by northeast...{3}...In the town envolped in mist...{3}the one you seek awaits.{2}
To the north...somewhere{3}on a small island...{3}the one you seek awaits.{2}
Head north by northwest...{3}In a cave on the northern{3}continent in the Western Sea...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
To the north... In ruins chilled{3}by icy winds...{3}the one you seek awaits.{2}
Head east by northeast... In a{3}cave on a tiny islet...{3}the one you seek awaits.{2}
To the east...in the mountain{3}paths on the continent that{3}shifted from its foundations...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
To the southeast...in a village{3}lulled by the bleating of sheep,{3}the one you seek awaits.{2}
Head south by southeast... On{3}the cliffs of a continent that{3}shifted from its foundations...{1}The one you seek awaits...{2}
Head east by southeast... In{3}a town on a continent that{3}shifted from its foundation...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
Head east by northeast... On the{3}island where the sun rises...{3}the one you seek awaits.{2}
Head south by southeast... In the{3}ruins on the island of winter...{3}the one you seek awaits.{2}
To the northwest...in the{3}forest on the southern{3}island in the Western Sea...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
To the northwest...along the{3}coast of the northern{3}continent of the Western Sea...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
To the northwest...beside the{3}ruins on the southern continent{3}in the Western Sea...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
Head north by northwest...{3}At the great rock on this{3}continent...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
To the north...in the ruins{3}chilled by icy winds...{3}the one you seek awaits...{2}
Head east by northeast... In a{3}cave on the continent that{3}shifted from its foundations...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
Head east by southeast... In the{3}desert on the southern land...{3}the one you seek awaits...{2}
Head east by southeast... In a{3}cave on the southern continent{3}in the Eastern Sea...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
To the north...in the mountain{3}paths of this continent...{3}the one you seek awaits.{2}
To the east... Somewhere{3}on a tiny islet...{3}the one you seek awaits.{2}
To the east... In the forest{3}on the isle of winter...{3}the one you seek awaits.{2}
Head north by northwest...{3}In a village on the northern{3}continent in the Western Sea...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
In the northwest...in the ruins{3}on the southern continent in{3}the Western Sea...{1}The one you seek awaits.{2}
Head north by northwest... Near{3}the spring before the rugged{3}path...the one you seek awaits.{2}
To the north...in the ruins{3}lying in the village...{3}the one you seek awaits.{2}
Head north by northeast... On{3}the island where the treasure{3}lies...the one you seek awaits...{2}
In the item you have placed{3}before me, I can see nothing{3}of the future...{2}
My father is a fortune-teller,{3}not a witch doctor.{1}There are a great many{3}differences between him{3}and Akafubu of Kibombo.{2}
By painting our bodies, we{3}bring about good luck.{3}You should try it, too.{2}
The items that one carries are{3}filled with one's hopes and{3}desires.{1}I can sense these desires,{3}and I can see answers{3}hidden within them.{2}
My father may not be a witch{3}doctor, but he could easily{3}defeat Akafubu.{2}
Body painting also protects{3}us from the magic of the{3}witch doctor, or so I'm told.{2}
If you are burdened with many{3}concerns, take a weapon{3}to the fortune-teller.{1}He can read your future{3}by studying the weapons{3}that you carry.{2}
I can look at any weapon and{3}see the monsters it faced,{3}but I cannot read its future.{2}
You should visit the fortune-{3}teller while you are in our{3}village.{1}By looking at the items you{3}possess, he can see what it{3}is that troubles you.{2}
Whenever I get my fortune{3}read, I offer up some armor.{1}I think this might be why{3}I find so many rare and{3}valuable artifacts.{2}
No one can see the future.{3}Absolutely no one. Except{3}for our fortune-teller.{1}Just by looking at your{3}items, he can see the path{3}you're meant to follow.{2}
Even if I wanted my fortune{3}told, I don't have any armor{3}or weapons to show him.{1}If he were only willing to{3}look at other items, I'm sure{3}he'd get more business.{2}
If you like adventure, you{3}should head out west{3}across the river...{1}Oh, wait... With all the rain{3}we've had lately, the river is{3}probably too deep to cross.{2}
Our cooking is famous all{3}across Gondowan.{1}If you find you like it,{3}come back soon! We change{3}our menu every season.{2}
The river is probably very{3}dangerous right now.{1}It's filled with monsters{3}when the waters are{3}running high.{2}
Our spices are our secret.{3}Everyone loves spicy food,{3}even if they regret it later.{1}And I'll thump the first{3}person that tries to tell{3}me otherwise!{2}
!{2}
I am but a humble pilgrim,{3}serving the greater good{3}in the heart of Gondowan.{1}Travelers should know that{3}even in this wild land, aid{3}is not far off.{2}
Anywhere I can do some{3}good, I will serve without{3}complaint.{1}Although...it would be nice if{3}it were a little cooler here.{2}
Don't tell me you just came{3}back from Kibombo!{1}You must be really brave{3}to have made it there and{3}back again!{2}
I didn't see any Kibombo{3}soldiers in the mountain{3}pass... Where did they go?{2}
I saw smoke rising from{3}Kibombo... Were they having{3}a bonfire or something?{2}
Some soldiers came through{3}here looking for a guy{3}named {17}{8}.{1}They looked unhappy that{3}I'd never heard of him.{2}
The smoke coming from{3}the Kibombo Mountains is{3}coming from a signal fire.{1}The signals are hard to read,{3}though. Whoever's sending{3}them isn't terribly good at it.{2}
The fortune-teller predicted{3}that the Kibombo will settle{3}down for a time...{1}I hope for all of our sakes{3}that he's right.{2}
A man came through a while{3}ago. He said he was going{3}to Kibombo.{1}He hasn't come back yet.{3}I think the guards in the{3}mountains caught him.{2}
I mentioned Magma Rock{3}to a traveler the other day,{3}and he was very intrigued.{1}I can't be sure, but I think{3}he might have headed in{3}that direction.{2}
Who would travel to{3}Kibombo right now? It's{3}not very safe right now.{2}
I'm so glad the Kibombo{3}aren't lurking over us in{3}the hills anymore...{1}They were here, they{3}were there, they were{3}everywhere!{2}
That smoke's been rising from{3}Kibombo for a while... I doubt{3}it's just a fire...{2}
What kind of a name is{3}{17}{8}. An odd one, certainly.{2}
The signals say something{3}has...ended? Or maybe has{3}been chosen?{1}It's so hard to figure out...{3}I wish they were a little{3}better at smoke signals.{2}
The fortune-teller has never{3}been wrong...{1}But I can't imagine that{3}the Kibombo would ever{3}really calm down.{2}
If the man they were looking{3}for has gone to Kibombo,{3}they're better off waiting.{1}Kibombo is a dangerous{3}place for outsiders right now.{2}
I don't think anyone can{3}reach Magma Rock now.{3}The river is too deep.{2}
Ouch... Some big brute came{3}through here looking for a{3}woman named Menardi.{1}I told him I'd never heard of{3}her, and he shoved me to the{3}ground and stormed off!{2}
What has gone wrong with{3}the world? People have no{3}respect for their elders!{2}
I guess those warriors learned{3}much about their future from{3}the fortune-teller.{1}You should do the same.{3}Bring your items to him,{3}just as they did.{2}
Our fortune-teller has been{3}saying some horrible things{3}lately.{1}He's been telling everyone{3}that "our peace shall soon{3}sleep." It's not very comforting.{2}
The power of the fortune-teller{3}is great. Anyone who listens to{3}his advice benefits greatly.{2}
The fortune-teller said that the{3}power of nature would rekindle{3}the advance of civilization.{1}But which is better, an{3}advanced civilization, or{3}a peaceful one?{2}
If trouble resides in your{3}heart, I suggest you speak{3}with my father.{2}
Reading fortunes in people's{3}items takes a lot of energy, so{3}he's not always willing to do it.{1}But if you have 20 coins on{3}you, he might be a little more{3}willing.{2}
Items placed before me are filled{3}with the desires of those{3}who place them there.{1}If I can sense those desires, I{3}can answer that which they seek.{2}
Father should charge{3}more for his readings.{1}People profit from what he{3}tells them. Why shouldn't{3}he profit from telling them?{2}
After Father's been reading{3}all day, he sleeps like a baby.{3}A really loud, snoring baby.{2}
Whenever I get customers{3}from out of town, I always{3}tell them the same thing...{1}"The fortune-teller sees all."{3}Nobody can resist trying{3}it at least once.{2}
When I look at weapons, I{3}can instantly tell what{3}monsters they have fought.{2} 
If you wish to know anything,{3}go to the fortune-teller. He's{3}fast, accurate, and affordable.{2}
I like offering armor to the{3}fortune-teller. It usually{3}gets me good results.{2}
Strangers to our town{3}would do well to visit the{3}fortune-teller's hut.{2}
Those who become lost should{3}offer the fortune-teller one{3}of their hard-earned items.{2}
If {17}{8} is traveling{3}in your group, please give{3}him this message:{1}{17}{1} and his companions{3}would like to speak{3}with him.{2}
I see so many travelers...{3}How am I supposed to{3}remember who {17}{8} is?{1}And why would anyone come{3}all the way to Gondowan to{3}find him? What does {17}{1} want?{2}
He paid me a lot of money{3}to pass this message on, but{3}how would he know if I didn't?{1}Ah, I'm too honest for my own{3}good. I'll keep passing {17}{1}'s{3}message on to my guests.{2}
Why would {17}{1} travel{3}all this way in search of a{3}man he has never met?{1}What could it be that drives{3}him to look for this{3}{17}{8}?{2}
!{2}
It's strange. As hot as it is{3}here in Gondowan, if you head{3}south, it's bitter cold...{1}The land of Tundaria is{3}a frozen wasteland that{3}deserves its name.{2}
The cold of Tundaria stifles{3}virtually all living things.{1}Compared to that barren land,{3}Gondowan's heat is comforting.{2}
Akafubu's ceremony is set to{3}begin soon. I wonder if he'll{3}succeed this time.{2}
During the last ceremony,{3}Akafubu made the jewel{3}float in the air...{1}But the mouth of the Great{3}Gabomba did not open.{2}
I'm afraid of what Akafubu{3}will do if he fails the{3}ceremony a second time.{2}
During the last ceremony,{3}the Great Gabomba didn't{3}move. It just stared silently.{2}
It's strange that Akafubu{3}decided to try again tonight.{3}What bolstered his confidence?{2}
The Great Gabomba is{3}supposed to open his{3}mouth if Akafubu is worthy.{2}
When he fails the ceremony,{3}Akafubu gets so angry...{1}I hope he doesn't turn his{3}anger on to me... I'm afraid{3}of his powerful magic.{2}
It would be great to see the{3}Gabomba open its mouth. Please,{3}Akafubu... Do it right this time!{2}
I hope the Great Gabomba is{3}satisfied by Akafubu's jewel{3}and opens his mouth this time.{2}
Is making the jewel float{3}with the power of his mind{3}all there is to it?{1}I would have thought a ceremony{3}like this would have required{3}a little more effort.{2}
Rumor has it that after failing the{3}last time, Akafubu sat alone in{3}the shadows, crying to himself.{2}
When the Gabomba is angered,{3}his eyes glow with rage and{3}fire shoots out of his mouth.{2}
If the Great Gabomba opens{3}his mouth, he will have{3}acknowledged Akafubu's power.{1}When the Great Gabomba{3}accepts the jewel,{3}the door will open.{2}
He's failed so many times{3}already...{1}Won't the same thing happen{3}again if he tries it another time?{2}
As Oeia's disciple, Akafubu{3}had a bad reputation for always{3}crying and complaining.{2}
I hope Akafubu hasn't angered{3}the Great Gabomba. I would be{3}sorry to see him die like that...{2}
I think Akafubu will speak of the{3}great witch doctor Oeia's fate.{2}
Akafubu was a good man{3}when he was training with{3}Oeia...{1}After Oeia died, Akafubu was{3}simply no longer the same.{2}
Akafubu looks really confident{3}tonight. I think he just might{3}succeed this time!{2}
If the Great Gabomba likes{3}the jewel, his mouth will open{3}and his tongue will stick out.{1}It sounds weird, but it's a{3}sign that the Gabomba{3}accepts the offering.{2}
Akafubu is so different{3}from Oeia, so impatient.{1}Why did Oeia have to{3}leave us so suddenly?{2}
Akafubu has not yet attained{3}the magical skill that Oeia{3}possessed...{1}I worry for our future if{3}Akafubu's character is as{3}weak as his magic.{2}
He travels to Madra and returns{3}with a stolen gem, and now he{3}expects us to call him a hero?{2}
If the Great Gabomba actually{3}moves and sticks out his tongue...{3}I might just faint!{2}
Akafubu has tried this before,{3}but he has always failed.{1}Tonight is different, though. With{3}this new gem, he may succeed.{2}
Hey, no pushing! You're not{3}going to get any closer, with{3}all these people packed in here.{2}
The heat is terrible tonight...{3}Of course, it's not so much the{3}heat as it is the humidity...{1}At this point, I don't care if{3}Akafubu ever succeeds, just{3}so long as he's quick about it!{2}
My grandfather spoke of a time{3}when the Gabomba was so{3}angry that its eyes popped out!{1}After that, he says, nothing good{3}ever happened in Kibombo.{3}Nothing. It was a bad omen.{2}
As a child, Akafubu was every{3}bit as horrible. He always cried{3}when he had to share his toys.{1}When he was good, he was{3}very, very good...but when{3}he was bad, he was AWFUL.{2}
There are so many people here!{3}If I want to see the ceremony,{3}I'll have to climb the posts!{2}
If Akafubu hopes to become{3}our witch doctor, he'll have{3}to enter the Great Gabomba.{1}He's a slow child... It'll take him{3}a while, I can tell.{2}
I wonder what Oeia did to{3}make the Great Gabomba's{3}eyes pop out...{2}
Akafubu is attempting the{3}ceremony again tonight.{1}Oeia performed the same{3}ceremony with no problems.{3}What's holding Akafubu back?{2}
Akafubu seems perturbed{3}lately. I think his failures are{3}weighing heavily on him.{1}He seems pompous, but it's{3}only his lack of confidence{3}showing through.{2}
He who is the witch doctor of{3}Kibombo holds the most revered{3}office in our whole town.{2}
Oeia's sudden death brought{3}pressure and responsibility on{3}Akafubu, well before his time.{2}
Oeia was a great witch doctor{3}and a compassionate leader.{1}Poor Akafubu... He may be a good{3}man, but he will never match Oeia.{2}
Once, these ceremonies were{3}guided by both the witch doctor{3}and his apprentice.{1}Akafubu is little more than an{3}apprentice himself... It's no{3}surprise that he struggles so.{2}
If only Oeia had taught his{3}magic to someone else...{1}If he had another pupil, this{3}would go more easily on poor{3}Akafubu. He would not be alone.{2}
I wonder if Akafubu even wanted{3}to study magic or to become{3}Oeia's sucessor.{2}
Akafubu blames his failures{3}on the jewel he originally used.{3}He claims it was no good.{1}That's why he led a team of{3}soldiers to find a new one.{2}
Akafubu used his abilities to see{3}the future. That's how he knew{3}to find the jewel in Madra.{2}
If the Great Gabomba's mouth{3}doesn't open, Akafubu must not{3}yet be a true witch doctor.{2}
I wonder what will happen tonight.{3}I'm so anxious, I can't stand it.{3}When will everything start?{2}
They attacked some town{3}to get the jewel he needed.{3}I hope no one was injured.{2}
I wonder how accurate Akafubu's{3}predictions are...{1}I mean, if he were any good,{3}shouldn't he be able to predict{3}the outcome of this ceremony?{2}
I feel so much excitement...{3}At last, will the Great Gabomba{3}recognize Akafubu's strength?{2}
I can't explain it, but I have a{3}feeling that, tonight, Akafubu's{3}ceremony will be different.{2}
At last, the sacred night{3}has come!{2}
Tonight, Akafubu becomes the{3}Kibombo's new witch doctor!{2}
All of you, pray in the{3}depths of your hearts{3}for my success!{2}
It looks like the initiation{3}ceremony is beginning.{2}
I'm not sure what will happen,{3}but we'd better hurry, {17}{5}.{2}
Wh-Who are you?!?{2}
What... What are your intentions?{2}
It looks like {17}{8} has{3}already forgotten us, huh?{30}
I know! We met {17}{8} when{3}he was in JAIL! And it's not like{3}he had lots of visitors, either!{2}
What, is he so obsessed with{3}his black orb that he can't{3}even remember us?{2}
Wait a second... I know you...{2}
You're the travelers who came{3}seeking me when I was in jail.{2}
So, you {9}{2}do{7} remember!{2}
What are you doing{3}in this place?{2}
Actually, that's what we{3}wanted to ask you...{2}
We were worried about you,{3}{17}{8}, so we followed{3}you here...{2}
And that's what brings you{3}to this dangerous place?{2}
What's that supposed to mean?{2}
We came here to help you,{3}{17}{8}. Why are you being{3}like that about it?{2}
Tell me something...{3}Exactly when did I ask{3}you for your help?{2}
SILENCE!{2}
I shall now present our jewel{3}to the Great Gabomba!{2}
!!!{2}
O Great Gabomba!{3}Please accept this,{3}our humble gift!{2}
Please, Great Gabomba!{3}Accept this jewel!{2}
Look! The Great Gabomba has{3}noticed the light of the jewel!{2}
Why, Great Gabomba?{2}
Your prayers were weak!{3}Open your hearts to the{3}Great Gabomba!{2}
Sing your praises and dance for{3}the Great Gabomba until your{3}prayers reach his ears!{2}
Akafubu is no witch doctor!{3}He's an Adept!{2}
I may have to confront{3}him to get my orb back...{3}I may have to fight.{2}
I will do whatever it takes,{3}but I will have my black{3}orb back again.{2}
It's no use. We can't get to{3}Akafubu from here.{2}
This won't work, either...{3}What are we going to do?{3}We can't get over there!{2}
{17}{8}'s in trouble.{3}Shouldn't we try to help him?{2}
Maybe if we could do something{3}about that stump, we could reach{3}the backside of Gabomba.{2}
We've got to help {17}{8}.{3}Right, {17}{5}?{30}
Then hop to it!{2}
What's all this now, {17}{5}?{3}Is it too much to ask that you{3}help {17}{8} in his time of need?{2}
He seems to believe{3}we are enemies...{2}
I hope he doesn't think{3}we're with the Kibombo.{2}
I must admit, you don't{3}look much like Kibombo...{2}
But that begs the question, if{3}you're not Kibombo, then who are{3}you, and why have you come here?{2}
They are...warriors.{3}But how did you{3}get in here?{2}
Why are these warriors{3}in a place like this?{2}
I'm not sure how to answer that...{2}
Actually, we've been looking for{3}a boat... We kinda need one.{2}
You're looking for a boat...{3}in the middle of the continent?{3}That seems like a bad idea.{2}
Hey, this wasn't exactly{3}our first choice, you know?{2}
A tidal wave destroyed all the{3}boats in the coastal towns.{2}
You're asking me to believe{3}rather a lot, don't you think?{2}
SILENCE!{2}
I shall now present our jewel{3}to the Great Gabomba!{2}
!!!{2}
O Great Gabomba!{3}Please accept this,{3}our humble gift!{2}
Please, Great Gabomba!{3}Accept this jewel!{2}
Look! The Great Gabomba has{3}noticed the light of the jewel!{2}
Gabomba, why?{2}
Your prayers were weak!{3}Open your hearts to the{3}Great Gabomba!{2}
Sing your praises and dance for{3}the Great Gabomba until your{3}prayers reach his ears!{2}
Akafubu is no witch doctor!{3}He's an Adept!{2}
I may have to confront{3}him to get my orb back...{3}I may have to fight.{2}
I will do whatever it takes,{3}but I will have my black{3}orb back again.{2}
It's no use. We can't get to{3}Akafubu from here.{2}
This won't work, either...{3}What are we going to do?{3}We can't get over there!{2}
{17}{8}'s in trouble.{3}Shouldn't we try to help him?{2}
Maybe if we could do something{3}about that stump, we could reach{3}the backside of Gabomba.{2}
We've got to help {17}{8}.{3}Right, {17}{5}?{30}
Then hop to it!{2}
What's all this now, {17}{5}?{3}Is it too much to ask that you{3}help {17}{8} in his time of need?{2}
Well, if you're going to help him,{3}you'd better do something about{3}the stump blocking the path...{2}
The orb is right before me,{3}and yet I cannot reach it...{2}
I am certain I just sensed the{3}power of Psynergy, but that{3}can't possibly be...{2}
?!?{2}
That power... Was that{3}Psynergy?{30}
I knew it!{2}
Please, don't try to complicate{3}things by lying... It must have{3}been Psynergy...{2}
I should have spotted it at once!{3}You're Adepts!{2}
Wait, so does that mean you're{176}{2}
Yes, my name is {17}{8},{3}and I too am an Adept.{2}
To be honest, everyone in{3}Lemuria is an Adept, and{3}not just me.{2}
What's Lemuria?{2}
Lemuria is an island that lies{3}in the center of the Eastern Sea.{2}
Wait a second... You said Lemuria?{3}I've heard that name before...{2}
Of course! It was Lord Babi!{3}He often spoke to me of Lemuria.{2}
He said it was so advanced that{3}we can scarcely begin to imagine{3}what it must have been like...{2}
You are correct. My home was and{3}is all that you say. Whoever told{3}you this knows much of Lemuria.{2}
But wait, if it's so far away in{3}the middle of the ocean, how come{3}anyone knows so much about it?{2}
It is not easily reached, and{3}we Lemurians seldom leave...{1}I cannot imagine how anyone{3}could have learned anything at{3}all about us.{2}
Except... Hold on a moment...{3}Babi... I've heard that name{3}somewhere before...{2}
Well, yeah... Everyone knows{3}about Lord Babi... He's the ruler{3}of Tolbi...{2}
I've never heard of Tolbi. Until{3}recently, I had never left my{3}home of Lemuria...{2}
{17}{8}, are you just{3}playing games with us?{2}
Don't be foolish. What would{3}I gain from lying to you?{2}
I'm being quite serious.{2}
{17}{8} is not playing{3}games, {17}{6}. You can{3}trust him.{2}
Thank you for believing{3}me, master sage!{2}
Please, call me Kraden,{3}{17}{8} of Lemuria.{2}
And I am the one who should{3}be thanking you!{2}
You look puzzled, {17}{5}.{3}You are probably wondering{3}what I'm talking about...{30}
Oh, good! Then I probably{3}don't need to tell you...{2}
Wait, just because my brother{3}knows what you're talking about{3}doesn't mean we do! Tell us!{2}
I thought as much...{2}
If what Babi told me is true,{3}Lemuria is all that remains of{3}a once great civilization.{2}
Your friend is correct.{2}
In fact, the reason I was sent to{3}Vale was somewhat related to my{3}inability to find Lemuria itself...{2}
I don't understand... What was{3}in Vale that had anything to{3}do with Lemuria?{2}
Babi believed that, in Lemuria{3}alone, the power of Alchemy{3}remains unbound.{2}
Lord Babi had need of Lemuria's{3}Alchemy, but despite our effort,{3}we could not find the lost city.{2}
Since we could not find Lemuria,{3}Lord Babi sent me to unlock the{3}secrets of Alchemy myself.{2}
Ah, yes! Babi! If I recall correctly,{3}a man named Babi came to{3}Lemuria long ago...{2}
He stole one of our ships{3}and fled the isle...{2}
Yes! That must indeed be the{3}same Lord Babi who know{3}leads the people of Tolbi.{2}
Now, I'm even more confused.{3}This is making my head hurt...{2}
I mean, if Babi really stole a ship{3}from your home, why would he be{3}trying so hard to find it again?{2}
I can't expect you to understand,{3}my dear. Lord Babi's reasons for{3}finding Lemuria are...complex.{2}
But if he already found Lemuria{3}once, why doesn't he just go{3}back the same way?{2}
Once you have left Lemuria,{3}finding it again is quite difficult,{3}even if you know where to look.{2}
Well...why?{2}
The waters around Lemuria are{3}wrapped in a perpetual fog...{3}It is very difficult to navigate.{2}
I remember Lord Babi once{3}saying something to that effect.{2}
Even if one locates Lemuria,{3}getting through the fog itself{3}remains quite a challenge.{2}
I don't get it... Why can't you{3}just sail straight through it?{2}
The ocean currents around{3}Lemuria are swift and{3}treacherous...{1}Only one who can sail{3}a Lemurian ship can{3}complete the journey.{2}
But...Babi stole a Lemurian ship{3}from you, right? That means that{3}he can sail it...{1}You said yourself that he used{3}it to flee the island!{2}
Unfortunately, Babi was the only{3}one of us who could use the ship.{2}
You see, Lemurian ships can only{3}be helmed by Adepts...{2}
Which is why I have to get my{3}black orb back! I must be able{3}to captain my ship!{2}
There may be something up{3}ahead on this path.{2}
Then let's go...{2}
Wait a moment, {17}{8}...{2}
We want to help you{3}get your orb back.{2}
You intend to help{3}me, Kraden?{2}
I am on this quest for many{3}reasons...one of them being{3}that I wish to see Lemuria.{2}
If you would allow me, that is...{3}I'd like to visit Lemuria myself.{2}
If this is something you would do{3}for Babi, then I cannot permit it.{2}
What? Why not?{2}
Babi is a thief. He is not{3}well loved in Lemuria.{2}
It is partially on behalf of Babi...{3}...but there's more to it than that!{2}
I want to go to Lemuria so{3}that I can see the full power{3}of Alchemy!{2}
I want to aid {17}{8} so that{3}he will take us to Lemuria...{3}What do you say, {17}{5}?{30}
You'll do it!?{3}Splendid!{2}
Why, {17}{5}? Why?{3}Please, we simply have to!{2}
What's the matter with you,{3}{17}{5}? I don't see why{3}we can't help {17}{8}.{2}
Yeah. I'm with {17}{6}{3}on this one.{2}
I appreciate your offer,{3}but...{2}
I understand, {17}{8}...{3}You're not sure if you'll be able{3}to take us to Lemuria, is that it?{2}
Can't we talk about this later?{2}
Yes, yes, of course! For now,{3}let's just get that orb back{3}for {17}{8}!{2}
Now that I know the orb is here,{3}I won't leave this village without{3}it! I will go alone if I must!{2}
You've come to help me get my{3}orb back? Thank you, all of you!{2}
Oh... Oh my... I've heard of{3}ceremonies like these... Foreign{3}deities are so frightening...{2}
Hmm?{2}
So, the ceremony is finally{3}over. Well! Isn't that...nice...{2}
I wonder if a man in my{3}position should really be{3}in a place like this.{2}
It's a dead end...{2}
But this was the only path...{2}
Isn't it a little strange that{3}there would be a path that{3}just goes nowhere like this?{2}
Hmm...{2}
I see...{2}
So that's how it works...{2}
Listen up, {17}{5}...{2}
Dig there!{30}
Don't worry. Just use Scoop...{3}You'll see why in just a{3}few seconds...{2}
I see...{2}
What's this?{2}
Someone has put something{3}in the ground here.{2}
And this statue...{2}
Well, take a look...{2}
{17}{5}! Try using Scoop{3}around there!{2}
Ah... I thought so...{2}
You thought what?{2}
These marks are here to{3}indicate an entrance there,{3}in the center of the design...{2}
You mean we can go{3}inside this statue?{2}
You could at one point...{2}
The entrance was probably{3}beneath that stone.{2}
I wonder... Was this the only one?{2}
It seems that way...{2}
Man, if this was the only entrance,{3}then I feel bad for the people{3}who built this statue.{2}
Why is that?{2}
Well, if this is the only hole,{3}then there's no way for air to{3}get in or out...{1}It must have been really{3}hot when they were working{3}in there!{2}
I...hadn't even thought of that.{2}
We must inspect this area{3}carefully, {17}{5}.{2}
{17}{6} has raised{3}an interesting point...{2}
If people did indeed build this,{3}they would not have been able{3}to do it without an air supply.{2}
They might have opened a vent{3}somewhere nearby.{2}
And if so, then there may have{3}been a ladder to enter the vent.{3}We should try to find it.{2}
Kraden, there doesn't seem{3}to be anything of the sort here!{2}
What were we just looking at?{2}
If there is a vent shaft, it{3}would probably be quite old,{3}maybe even buried...{1}Exactly like those marks we{3}just uncovered!{2}
And if that's the case, we{3}should search more thoroughly.{2}
OK, {17}{5}!{2}
Focus your energies!{2}
Everyone! Look over here!{2}
Let us now present our jewel{3}to the Great Gabomba!{2}
O Great Gabomba!{3}Please accept this,{3}our humble gift!{2}
Please, Great Gabomba!{3}Accept this jewel!{2}
Look! The Great Gabomba has{3}noticed the light of the jewel!{2}
You are still not pleased?{2}
No! This time, he seemed{3}almost like he might...{2}
We must continue!{3}Drums! More drums!{2}
Ah! So that's how it works!{2}
He's been failing because{3}the conduit that channels{3}his Psynergy is broken.{2}
Should we reconnect the{3}conduit so he can complete{3}the ceremony?{30}
I won't help them, {17}{5}!{3}They're the ones who stole my{3}orb from the Madrans!{2}
I agree, {17}{5}!{3}Why should we help this{3}pack of thieves?{2}
{17}{8}, I understand that{3}you're angry at them, but it really{3}is in our best interest to help.{2}
Think about it, {17}{8}...{3}Akafubu stole the orb solely to{3}perform this ceremony...{2}
So, what do you think he{3}intends to do with the orb?{2}
He means to give it to{3}the Great Gabomba...{2}
Oh! So...if his ceremony succeeds,{3}the orb will be taken into the{3}statue...{2}
And we're INSIDE the statue!{3}If the ceremony succeeds,{3}we can go find the orb!{2}
I...don't want to help{3}that Akafubu, but...{2}
I don't like the idea of helping{3}him any more than you do, but{3}if we can end this without a fight...{2}
You're right, {17}{7}. Let's see{3}if we can't help him finish{3}his little ceremony.{2}
It looks like the energy charge{3}is supposed to run over these{3}blocks.{2}
If we can just move these around{3}a little, that might be enough to{3}complete the circuit...{2}
Ah! There we go!{2}
These panels have arrows on{3}them... What do you think it{3}all means?{2}
Look at the directions they{3}point... I'll bet these will{3}rotate the blocks...{2}
But how do we set the{3}blocks back in place?{2}
Just Pound them in!{2}
Won't that do the trick?{2}
We must watch the path his{3}Psynergy takes and move{3}the blocks accordingly.{2}
Oh! The magic, the power of{3}the witch doctor fills my body!{2}
At the count of twenty, I{3}shall present our jewel to{3}the Great Gabomba!{2}
Make your hearts as one,{3}and dance for the Great{3}Gabomba!{2}
O Great Gabomba!{3}Please accept this,{3}our humble gift!{2}
You are still not pleased?{2}
No! This time, he seemed{3}almost like he might...{2}
We must continue!{3}Drums! More drums!{2}
Look! Look! The Great Gabomba{3}has seen our jewel!{2}
Ahh! We have enraged{3}the Great Gabomba!{2}
No! Great catastrophe shall{3}befall the Kibombo!{2}
Silence! SILENCE!{2}
Do not be hasty! The Great{3}Gabomba has not opened{3}his eyes in anger!{2}
Your prayers...have not{3}appeased him... That is all!{2}
Pray! You must pray more!{3}Let the Great Gabomba hear{3}our desires!{2}
Drums! More drums!!!{2}
Look! The Great Gabomba has{3}responded to our gift!{2}
Wahhh! The Great Gabomba{3}spews jets of flame!{2}
It is the end of Kibombo!{3}Our village is doomed!{2}
Silence! SILENCE!{2}
Do not be hasty, my people!{3}The Great Gabomba is not{3}angered by our ceremony!{2}
He is angered by the presence{3}of wicked thoughts!{2}
Cast away your wicked{3}thoughts! Dance! Dance{3}for the Great Gabomba!{2}
Drums! More drums!!!{2}
Look! The Great Gabomba has{3}responded to our gift!{2}
Did you see it, people?{2}
At last! The Great Gabomba{3}accepts me!{2}
I shall answer his call! I shall{3}enter the Great Gabomba!{3}Wait for me, my people!{2}
The black orb... Where is it?{2}
I saw it roll in there...{2}
It came in through there{3}and rolled along this{3}groove in the floor...{2}
It vanished into that hole!{2}
It looks pretty deep...{2}
Can you see it? Do you{3}think you can reach it?{2}
Hm... No, I can't even see it.{2}
It's no use... Now, I'll never{3}see Lemuria again... I am lost{3}forever from my homeland!{2}
Wait, hold on... I can see light{3}on the other side of this hole...{2}
A light?{2}
There must be a room{3}on the other side of{3}this statue...{2}
Who... Who are you!?{2}
What are you doing here?{3}Are you Kibombo!?{30}
What? Do you take me for{3}a naive fool!?{2}
Then what are you doing{3}inside the Great Gabomba!?{2}
We've come to reclaim the{3}black orb you stole!{2}
Do you really believe{3}I would permit you to{3}take it!?{2}
Hey, watch it! You wouldn't{3}even be in here if it weren't{3}for us!{2}
What is that supposed to mean?{2}
Why should I believe you?{3}I am Akafubu, the chosen{3}witch doctor of Kibombo!{2}
Yeah, we know... We saw your{3}magic energy flowing past us.{2}
See how this channel runs{3}along the floor?{2}
Here, look... It runs all the{3}way over there!{2}
But the thing is, the circuit{3}was broken right there.{2}
So we completed the circuit so{3}that your magic energy could{3}go where it needed to go.{2}
But...if you truly did this,{3}then why? Why did you{3}help me?{2}
We were sort of hoping that{3}we could take the orb if your{3}ceremony succeeded...{2}
Ah, so you have taken the orb?{3}Then begone! You have no{3}further business here!{2}
But...we didn't get the orb.{2}
It rolled through this groove{3}and right through this hole.{2}
We saw a light through there,{3}so we suspect there must be{3}another room behind the wall...{2}
I might be able to{3}retrieve the orb.{2}
Do you think Akafubu will really{3}return the orb to us?{30}
Maybe we had him all wrong...{2}
I think {17}{6} is right.{3}It sounds like he's going to{3}return what he has stolen.{2}
I thought Akafubu was an evil{3}man, but I guess we were wrong...{2}
You never can tell, {17}{7}...{2}
We have little choice but to{3}trust that he will return it.{3}Come on!{2}
Let's go, {17}{5}!{2}
Ahh! Something is coming{3}from within the Great Gabomba!{3}Are you men, or are you...gods?{2}
You look human...but perhaps{3}you are the ones who created the{3}Great Gabomba, reborn before us!{2}
Akafubu possesses the power{3}to enter the Great Gabomba! My{3}faith is restored!{2}
We must stand guard and{3}wait until Akafubu's return!{2}
Men or gods, we fear you not!{1}The Kibombo fear nothing!{2}
It seems these beasts want{3}to pass through...{1}Can't you see we are in the{3}midst of our ceremony!?{1}None shall pass until{3}it is complete!{2}
This isn't a bad way to spend{3}an evening, when you get right{3}down to it.{1}I could dance all night{3}and all day tomorrow, too.{2}
It is proper for a warrior to{3}be a man of few words.{1}It is the fearful dog who{3}barks the loudest.{2}
They look like people, but how{3}could they be here now? I cannot{3}believe it!{1}Why doesn't my magic{3}amulet have any effect{3}on them?{2}
If no person other than Akafubu{3}can enter the Great Gabomba...{1}Then these people{3}aren't really people{3}at all!{2}
I saw Akafubu's power open{3}the jaw of the Great Gabomba.{1}I saw it happen, but I still{3}don't believe it. But...{3}I SAW it happen...{2}
I hope Akafubu completes{3}the ceremony soon... I'm so{3}sleepy... I want to go home.{2}
What if the Great Gabomba only{3}opened its mouth to lure Akafubu{3}in and...crush him like a grape!{2}
Look at these guys. They think{3}they're so hot... I bet they think{3}they're gonna get past me...{1}They have no idea how long I{3}can stand here, saying the same{3}thing to them, over and over.{2}
Sure, this is fun, but my feet{3}hurt! I never want to hear an{3}irresistible dance beat again!{2}
*Koff! Koff!* All this chanting is{3}making my throat hurt! No more{3}singing in the shower for me.{2}
Akafubu has been inside the{3}Great Gabomba for a while now.{3}How long is he going to take?{2}
I think Akafubu's has finally{3}succeeded at his ceremony.{1}Maybe Kibombo will finally{3}be peaceful once again.{2}
Tonight seems to have been{3}a good night... I was worried,{3}since Akafubu kept failing.{2}
Once the ceremony is complete,{3}Kibombo will be like a village{3}reborn. Peace will come again.{2}
What? Don't ask me what{3}Akafubu's doing in there. I{3}was just wondering myself.{2}
They say the Great Gabomba's{3}great jaw finally opened.{1}I wish I could go up front{3}and get a better view.{2}
They told me I had to stay{3}awake until the ceremony's{3}over.{1}Usually, they tell me I have{3}to go to bed early! Make up{3}your minds already!{2}
Whew! Thank goodness those{3}drums have stopped. They{3}were rattling my brain!{2}
Last time Akafubu tried the{3}ceremony, he failed. I saw him{3}crying behind the statue after.{2}
Oeia's death was so sudden.{3}It's been hard on Akafubu.{2}
Akafubu sees the future...{3}That's how he knew to{3}find the jewel in Madra.{2}
I believe in Akafubu. I believe{3}he will surpass Oeia and{3}become a great witch doctor.{2}
What's taking so long? We{3}can't finish the ceremony until{3}Akafubu comes back out.{2}
Akafubu is obsessed! He'll{3}keep trying this until he{3}gets it right.{1}Please, oh please, just{3}get it right tonight!!!{2}
Will the Great Gabomba finally{3}accept Akafubu and make him{3}our new witch doctor?{2}
Kibombo was so much better{3}when Oeia was our leader.{1}I wish we could return to that{3}life once again...{2}
I'm so far away from the action...{3}From back here, Akafubu looks{3}like a deranged mosquito!{2}
They're saying the Great Gabomba{3}opened his mouth, but I'll just{3}have to take their word for it.{1}I wish I were closer, so I could{3}see it and know for sure.{2}
As long as this ceremony's{3}going on, I get to stay up!{1}Normally, I get in trouble for{3}trying to stay up this late.{2}
Am I going to have to play{3}drums all night? Can't they{3}just...dance without them?{2}
Akafubu's always been a{3}crybaby. Whenever he failed{3}his lessons, he cried and cried.{2}
I suspect Akafubu never really{3}wanted to become the Kibombo{3}witch doctor. Poor boy.{2}
I really wonder how accurate{3}Akafubu's farsight is.{1}If his skills were stronger, he{3}should be able to prophesy the{3}outcome of this ceremony.{2}
Akafubu and Oeia are so{3}different... How can he ever{3}hope to replace Oeia?{1}Ah, why did Oeia have{3}to die? What are we to do?{2}
I have followed Oeia's{3}instructions and entered{3}the final chamber!{2}
He told me that if I reached{3}this chamber, I would become{3}Kibombo's witch doctor.{2}
But what must I do here to{3}become a witch doctor?{2}
I do not know...{2}
Your black orb rests in the hands{3}of the statue before you. Go on,{3}take it.{2}
Oeia... What am I to do now?{2}
Oh, young witch doctor... You{3}have succeeded in your task.{3}You have found this chamber.{2}
Wh-Who speaks?{2}
It sounded like it was the{3}statue of the Great Gabomba.{2}
That's ridiculous...{2}
Akafubu! Your magic has grown{3}strong! At last, you are worthy{3}of the title witch doctor.{2}
I give you the feathers and{3}gown that are the badges{3}of your office!{2}
Akafubu, from this day{3}forward, you shall be{3}Kibombo's witch doctor.{2}
I've done it! I've finally earned{3}the right to be witch doctor!{2}
At last!{2}
Yes!{2}
And there is one thing that{3}remains for me to give you...{2}
Akafubu... You hasty fool... I had{3}something else to give you, and{3}in your haste, you left too soon.{2}
Say, you there...{2}
Yes! You! You, looking{3}around there!{2}
I have magic for Akafubu,{3}magic that he will soon need,{3}...but he is not ready for it.{2}
As a result, I have decided that{3}I shall not pass this magic on{3}to anyone just yet.{2}
Tell this to Akafubu:{3}If he desires this new magic,{3}then he must earn it himself!{2}
If Akafubu does not refine his{3}magical arts, then he will never{3}earn this new power.{2}
This power shall not be realized{3}until he ceases living only for{3}himself...{1}And instead lives his{3}life to benefit others.{2}
Tell him so!{2}
I don't suppose you could{3}just...give that magic to us?{2}
What do you mean?{2}
I'm just asking if maybe we{3}could earn that magic before{3}Akafubu.{2}
The power can be claimed by{3}another, but only if Akafubu{3}lacks the will to earn it himself.{2}
Aha! So we CAN get it!{2}
Perhaps if he must compete{3}for his power, he will focus{3}and take his office seriously.{2}
But before you do this thing,{3}you must convey to Akafubu{3}all that I have told you.{2}
Oh, of course! We wouldn't{3}dream of cheating him... We will{3}tell him all you have told us.{2}
Follow that path, and you{3}will find a cavern...{2}
But now, I shall sleep...until{3}the time comes when I must{3}anoint a new witch doctor.{2}
{17}{5}... Go get {17}{8}'s{3}precious orb.{2}
{17}{5}... Do you have any{3}idea exactly what this "Great{3}Gabomba" really is?{30}
If you have unraveled that{3}which I cannot, then perhaps{3}you are the greater scholar.{2}
You do not understand either?{3}Then I do not feel quite so{3}foolish...{2}
But doesn't this witch doctor{3}magic seem not unlike some{3}kind of Psynergy?{2}
Wouldn't it be quite fortunate{3}if we were to get our hands{3}on that power ourselves?{30}
Oh! You didn't need{3}much convincing at{3}all, did you, {17}{5}?{2}
Hrmm... You would feel guilty{3}about taking it, eh, {17}{5}?{2}
I needn't remind you, but...{1}We're going to need every{3}kind of Psynergy we can muster{3}to complete this quest...{2}
Either way, {17}{5}, we are,{3}at the very least, obligated to{3}deliver the Gabomba's message.{2}
We must fulfill our promise{3}to the Gabomba.{2}
Then, maybe we can come back{3}inside this Gabomba statue{3}some other time to get it.{2}
{17}{5} carried the message{3}of the Gabomba to Akafubu.{1}By the time {17}{5} finished{3}his story, dawn had broken.{2}
It looks like just fixing the{3}channel should do the trick...{1}Maybe we need to look at{3}when the two magical charges{3}reach the statue in the middle.{2}
By reaching this place, you{3}have proven your power.{2}
By rights, Akafubu should bear{3}this power...{1}But I shall keep my promise{3}and bestow it upon the one{3}to reach this place first!{2}
I am grateful for your promise...{1}But I am worried that we have{3}done Akafubu and the Kibombo{3}a great wrong.{2}
Akafubu has not honed his own{3}powers, and the fault lies with{3}him alone...{1}And yet, there is a hint of{3}truth to what you say...{2}
Then what are we to do?{3}Does this mean we won't{3}receive your magic?{2}
As I have said, I will give{3}the power to you. Your{3}concern is misplaced.{2}
But I must add some small{3}conditions to our agreement...{2}
Wh-What kind of conditions?{2}
You must not...mention{3}this to Akafubu.{2}
Akafubu was plainly ill prepared{3}for this test. He will lose heart{3}if he hears what you have done.{1}And yet...the Kibombo have need{3}of this ill-prepared leader...{2}
If Akafubu ever reaches this{3}place, I shall teach him the{3}magic as well.{1}Promise me that you will not{3}tell Akafubu that you earned{3}this magic. Can you do this?{2}
Of course!{2}
And now I shall sleep.{3}Farewell, successor to the{3}witch doctor.{2}
Right... Well, I guess{3}that's that!{2}
You are virtuous men,{3}coming here to deliver this{3}message. My son and I thank you.{2}
What do we have{3}to be thankful of?{2}
If they had just stopped me{3}from leaving the Great Gabomba,{3}this wouldn't have happened!{2}
What!? If you had been more{3}interested in your duty, you{3}would not have left so quickly...{2}
But, Father! These people are{3}trying to steal the magic of our{3}people! It should be mine!{2}
Mine, I tell you! That power{3}belongs to me!{2}
I'm going to be the one to{3}get the Great Gabomba's{3}magic! You'll see!{2}
My son, you have much to learn.{3}He may look like a man, but{3}before me, he acts like a child.{2}
See how he behaves when{3}he gets excited?{2}
No matter what I say, he won't{3}listen to me right now.{2}
I think that he has had{3}enough for today...{2}
I see your point.{2}
Well! I suppose we should{3}be leaving then.{2}
After all, our journey has only{3}just begun. We cannot remain{3}idle much longer.{2}
Dang! Why did I leave that{3}stupid room so quickly?{3}Stupid, stupid, stupid Akafubu!{2}
After he became a witch{3}doctor, Akafubu had no more{3}reason to focus himself...{1}It is good that he now has a new{3}goal. He will have to work hard to{3}earn the Great Gabomba's magic.{2}
I just can't quite grasp the{3}Great Gabomba's magic.{1}Still, I'm trying really hard{3}to help everyone, just like{3}the Great Gabomba said...{2}
My son has been so kind{3}and compassionate since the{3}ceremony. He's a changed man.{1}He has focused on bettering{3}himself and earning the{3}Great Gabomba's magic.{2}
Akafubu has finally completed{3}his ceremony, and things are{3}starting to calm down.{1}Maybe now, our warriors can{3}set aside their spears and{3}return to their peaceful lives.{2}
It looks like there are fewer{3}warriors in Kibombo now, huh?{30}
All of our warriors were just{3}local farm boys...{1}Now that he's the witch doctor,{3}Akafubu let them all return{3}to their farming work.{2}
You couldn't tell? I thought{3}you might have been a little{3}more observant, but oh well...{2}
The Great Gabomba's mouth will{3}remain open until Akafubu has{3}earned the gift of the Gabomba.{1}Maybe I ought to sneak in there{3}and get a look around while I{3}have the chance.{2}
Now that the ceremony is over,{3}I feel a touch depressed.{1}I wish we could have more big{3}events like that soon.{2}
I couldn't for the life of me{3}figure out how our warriors{3}got to Indra without a boat.{1}But I just found out that{3}something has pushed Indra{3}into contact with Gondowan!{2}
Oh... I smell something{3}delectable. We'll be eating{3}some good meat soon.{2}
Good ol' meat... I love meat.{3}I can't wait until we get some.{2}
We get to eat normal animals{3}again! They taste so much better{3}than those monsters we've had!{2}
You didn't come to Kibombo{3}to get revenge on us for that{3}raid, did you?{30}
How many of you are there?{3}We've got some pretty{3}fierce warriors, you know...{1}You don't really think you{3}can defeat all of us, do you?{2}
Whew! That's good to hear.{3}We're supposed to protect the{3}village, but I feel bad for the raid.{2}
The other warriors are busy{3}hunting right now.{1}The food supply for the whole{3}village depends entirely on the{3}animals they catch.{2}
Now that Akafubu is our new{3}witch doctor, we shall embark{3}on a path to peace.{1}The neighboring villages have{3}no reason to fear our warriors{3}any longer.{2}
This is a signal fire. We use{3}these to send messages to{3}neighboring villages.{1}I hope these messages set{3}our neighbors' minds at ease.{2}
Everyone was terribly worried{3}about Akafubu's ceremony.{3}We're all relieved it's over now.{2}
Covering our warriors in paint{3}makes them scarier, and it makes{3}them more intimidating.{1}Most of our warriors aren't{3}that strong, so they need{3}every trick they can use.{2}
I want to look inside the Great{3}Gabomba at least once.{1}You don't suppose just peeking{3}will get me cursed, do you?{2}
Now that the witch doctor{3}ceremony is over, I've decided{3}that...it was kind of fun!{2}
Because Kibombo lies hidden{3}deep in the continent, we rarely{3}hear news of the Eastern Sea.{2}
You don't think anyone will notice{3}if I sneak a little nibble while I'm{3}cooking, do you?{2}
Gulp! The smell of that sauce over{3}the fire is making me so hungry...{3}How long until we can eat!?{2}
Lately the monsters have been{3}increasing, and the animals are{3}becoming more and more scarce.{1}That's why everyone's so{3}excited that we get to have{3}nice, normal steaks tonight!{2}
No one in Kibombo really wants{3}war with our neighbors.{1}We want everyone who shares{3}this land to share peace as well.{2}
With all our battles behind{3}us, we warriors spend our time{3}refilling the village food supply.{2}
I wonder if I can keep going until{3}another village sees our signal{3}and comes to meet with us...{1}I don't care which village it is,{3}just send a delegation! Fast!{2}
I have heard that if you head{3}west from southern Gondowan,{3}you'll see the Eastern Sea.{1}There are two continents{3}in the middle of that ocean:{3}Hesperia and Atteka.{2}
Are you going to head{3}to western Gondowan?{30}
That's unfortunate. The recent{3}rains have swollen the rivers.{1}It is too dangerous for{3}us to allow anyone to pass.{2}
That's for the best. It is far{3}too dangerous for anyone{3}to be going out west.{1}Perhaps a boat would lessen{3}the danger to a degree...{2}
You can see Atteka from the{3}bridge in western Gondowan.{3}My grandfather told me so.{1}Someday, I'll be a warrior like my{3}grandfather, and I'll be able{3}to see it for myself!{2}
I know I could find more animals{3}and grain on the far side of the{3}river. If only I could go...{1}These seasonal monsoon rains{3}have swollen the river and made{3}it too dangerous to cross.{2}
Crossing the river by canoe{3}is much too dangerous.{3}I'd need a ship to get across.{2}
If I'm ever going to be a warrior,{3}I must build more muscle and{3}master the art of the spear.{2}
If you are looking for treasure,{3}look west of the river.{1}The rocky peaks there are{3}called the belly of the continent.{3}Great treasure hides there.{2}
Each year, when the rains stop,{3}our warriors look for treasure{3}in the belly of the continent.{1}Maybe the belly is hidden, or{3}the treasure is also. I don't know,{3}but they all return empty-handed.{2}
Sure, our legends speak of much{3}treasure, but no one ever seems{3}to have found it.{2}
I wonder what Oeia meant when{3}he said that our magic is deeply{3}tied to the belly of the continent...{2}
Oh, my back... It's been aching{3}ever since that ceremony.{1}I guess I really am too old{3}to dance the night away.{2}
As soon as Akafubu became{3}our recognized witch doctor,{3}he became so much nicer.{2}
I swear, that's the{3}last time I'll ever let{3}loose like that again!{2}
Akafubu gets so grouchy.{3}I wonder if it's just his{3}frustration taking over...{2}
Many in Gondowan fear the{3}might of the Kibombo warriors.{3}But we don't want to be feared.{1}Now is the time for Kibombo{3}to change its image.{2}
We think it is time to inform{3}other villages that Akafubu{3}has completed the ceremony.{1}I think they'll be glad to know{3}that we no longer pose any{3}threat to them.{2}
It won't be easy, convincing{3}them that we've turned over{3}a new leaf...but we'll try.{2}
I am a mighty warrior, trained{3}from birth to be fierce. If you{3}are feared, you are powerful!{1}I'm...supposed to start my{3}"being nice to people" training{3}on Monday.{2}
The weapons I sell in this shop are{3}ones we do not use in Kibombo.{1}You find it strange that I{3}do not sell the weapons{3}we make here, don't you?{2}
Our warriors appear so strong{3}because of the deadly poison{3}on their spears.{1}In a war, Kibombo spears{3}would make a powerful ally.{2}
The only defenses we Kibombo{3}need are our shields and our{3}war paint.{1}Our warriors think armor{3}is for cowards.{2}
Because our paint is infused{3}with the witch doctor's magic,{3}we're safe from attacks.{1}I would opt for paint in any{3}battle...no matter how much{3}iron my enemy wore.{2}
I'm sorry, but the Kibombo{3}spearhead poison is a tribal{3}secret, used for hunting only.{1}We can't let outsiders have{3}it, because they might try{3}to turn it toward evil uses.{2}
If I had a coin for every time{3}some stranger came up and{3}asked me to sell them poison...{1}If only they'd let me sell it,{3}I could make millions!{2}
Don't worry about the beds{3}here... We used to have insect{3}problems, but not anymore.{1}We use a special bug powder{3}on our beds. It's quite harmless{3}to humans, I'll bet.{2}
I can't remember how long{3}it's been since we've had{3}any guests.{1}Tell you what... If you stay at{3}our inn, you can have all the{3}freshly grilled steak you want!{2}
That bed makes me itch{3}so badly! It feels like bugs{3}are crawling all over me!{1}Whenever I get itchy, I just{3}rub some of that bug powder{3}all over myself!{2}
I love Kibombo's famous{3}BBQ monster steak...with{3}extra-spicy Herb sauce!{1}It's a local treat that's fun{3}to eat! ...But it's not nearly{3}as fun catching the monsters...{2}
Kibombo's peace is restored{3}now that the ceremony has{3}reached its end...{1}Now, the fate of Kibombo's{3}people depends on how{3}Akafubu leads them.{2}
I can't believe that Akafubu{3}would change simply because{3}he completed the ceremony.{2}
The mayor finally returned{3}from Alhafra.{2}
Hey! It's you guys! It's good{3}to see you again!{1}You want to enter Madra?{3}Yeah, sure! Go ahead!{3}Feel free!{2}
He was gone so long, I was{3}starting to worry that the{3}mayor would never come back.{2}
How much longer do we{3}have to stand guard here?{1}Seriously, there's nothing to{3}guard against! We've already{3}been attacked by everyone!{2}
I don't think the mayor ever{3}got that boat of his fixed,{3}either... Got tired of waiting.{1}I guess he's going back out again{3}as soon as he finds enough people{3}to fix it himself.{2}
We go to all that work getting{3}the ship from Briggs, and now{3}we can't get it to work?{1}I guess the mayor's holding{3}a council to see if they can{3}figure out what's wrong.{2}
I heard the boat the mayor got{3}is much better than the battered{3}raft we used to have!{1}I also heard that the new ship can{3}even sail far across the sea!{2}
Is there by any chance a girl{3}named {17}{6} with you?{30}
Ah! Those people must have{3}been looking for you!{1}There were four of them, and{3}they looked weatherworn, but{3}they had an amazing ship.{2}
Oh... Well, if you run across anyone{3}named {17}{6}, let her know{3}{17}{1} is looking for her.{1}You look like you travel a lot.{3}Maybe you'll run across this{3}{17}{6} somewhere.{2}
Those travelers looked{3}worried about you.{1}You should find them, so that{3}they can know you are safe.{2}
I wonder if the legends are{3}true... If there really is a great{3}society on a far-off island...{1}Because if they are true, I{3}want to see this island.{2}
I don't know what will happen{3}when they all head out to sea.{3}They know nothing about sailing!{2}
A group of sharp-looking{3}travelers came through{3}here recently.{1}They said they were looking for{3}an island called Lemuria.{2}
If you have a big enough ship,{3}you can sail anywhere in the{3}world! Isn't that amazing?{2}
I was at the mayor's house,{3}watching them argue about{3}why the boat won't move.{1}What's so important about{3}a mast, and what does it have{3}to do with sailing?{2}
It's not that I don't want to go to{3}Alhafra... But what's the point if{3}we can't fix the mast?{2}
The mayor asked me to go to{3}Alhafra with him, but I'm not{3}sure I should...{1}If that ship runs on the power{3}of the wind, how reliable could{3}it really be?{2}
It seems no one is really happy{3}that the mayor got this grand,{3}new ship. The poor mayor...{2}
Say, {17}{8}, there was{3}another group of travelers with{3}powers similar to your own.{1}What are the odds that we{3}should meet two groups{3}with these amazing abilities?{2}
I thought Shin and the others{3}were lying, but after seeing{3}what I saw, I'd believe anything.{1}They called it Psynergy and said{3}it can change water into ice.{2}
When {17}{1} and his party{3}heard about {17}{8}, they{3}seemed shocked.{1}They said they were going to{3}follow you to Gondowan.{2}
Uhhhnnn... UHHHNNN!{2}
They told me that you make{3}Psynergy by focusing your{3}mind...{1}I've been focusing nonstop{3}for days, but do you see{3}any ice? No!{2}
How can anyone just create{3}ice by thinking about it?{1}I mean, imagine how much{3}power you'd have if you could{3}just think, and things happened!{2}
Why would anyone be happy{3}to have a broken boat?{2}
They've been having so many{3}meetings lately! I guess that{3}boat must be in miserable shape!{2}
Everyone gets the urge to{3}explore, to go out into the{3}wild and see new lands...{1}I'd love to see the world. I'd{3}love to have an adventure{3}of my own!{2}
I wonder why those travelers{3}were in such a hurry...{1}They looked so severe... You'd{3}think they carried the fate of{3}the world on their shoulders.{2}
What was that island again?{3}Come on, brain... Work with me...{3}Lemoria? Lemurland? Lulu?{2}
The people of Madra know our{3}own lands well...but we know{3}little of the world beyond.{1}What kind of fool would think{3}himself ready to sail into a{3}world he knew nothing about?{2}
That island that group{3}was asking about sounded{3}familiar for some reason...{1}Grandpa used to tell me stories{3}about a treasure island when I{3}was young. Was that the place?{2}
How big would a ship that{3}could go anywhere be?{3}Probably bigger than a whale!{2}
Everyone here in Madra is afraid{3}of the Kibombo now. Do they{3}scare you, too?{30}
I saw the fear in your eyes{3}the instant I said "Kibombo."{3}Don't get worked up, though.{1}We caught sight of a Kibombo{3}smoke signal that said they had{3}given up their warlike ways.{2}
You must have heard{3}their proclamation...{1}We only just caught sight{3}of their smoke signals... They{3}have announced a truce!{2}
We're still recovering from{3}the Kibombo raid...{1}It's no small wonder people{3}are still afraid...{2}
These new boats apparently{3}use the power of wind to cross{3}the seas...{1}I just don't understand how{3}a big pole in the boat can{3}help to capture the wind...{2}
If a building has broken{3}columns, we tear it down...{1}Shouldn't a boat with a{3}broken column be torn{3}down as well?{2}
Sailors are supposed to{3}use oars and pull the boat{3}through the water...{1}So, what's a sailor supposed{3}to do on a boat that's{3}powered by wind?{2}
Our mayor's done so little for{3}us up until now... We should at{3}least thank him for the boat.{2}
Is turning water to ice really{3}such a special power?{2}
Madra is always so hot. If{3}there were some way to create{3}ice, it would be so...cool.{2}
So, this {17}{8} fellow must{3}be a friend of {17}{1}...{1}Why else would they go all the{3}way to Gondowan for him?{2}
I knew I should have asked{3}them how to make ice...{2}
There's talk of mighty travelers{3}who passed by here recently.{3}I wish I could have met them.{1}It seems they had powers no one{3}has ever seen before. I bet those{3}powers could be profitable.{2}
Since things are finally calming{3}down in Madra, our people are{3}ready to get down to business.{1}They seem to have thought up{3}a business plan that makes use{3}of {17}{1}'s power.{2}
What if we just traveled with{3}{17}{1} to show off his powers...{3}We could make loads of cash!{2}
The business plan our people{3}have come up with is supposed{3}to make us rich.{1}I guess it must be{3}a brilliant plan.{2}
Our salesman said Kibombo's{3}ceremony is done, and he claims{3}that they're peaceful again.{1}I'll be so relieved if what he{3}said turns out to be true.{2}
I wonder if the Kibombo have{3}truly set aside their spears{3}and returned to peace...{2}
The continent shift makes it feel{3}like we're sharing backyards{3}with the Kibombo...{1}We'd be so happy if we could{3}live in peace without having to{3}fear their spears.{2}
The salesman that just came back{3}from Gondowan claims the{3}Kibombo are peaceful now...{1}But if we relax, we won't be{3}ready for their next attack.{2}
How are we to climb the cliffs{3}between here and Gondowan?{1}If someone would just drop{3}some ropes down from the{3}top, it wouldn't be a problem.{2}
My husband relishes those rare{3}mushrooms growing in the{3}Gondowan cliffs.{1}I wish someone would{3}bring some back for him.{2}
I'm dying for some of those{3}Gondowan mushrooms, but I{3}can't ever reach them.{2}
My poor husband's getting old...{3}Those cliffs scare him now.{1}In his prime, he'd have{3}scrambled up those cliffs{3}in no time for a mushroom.{2}
Oh, my... Is... Is that...{2}
Is that one of his most{3}favorite mushrooms!?{2}
Did you climb all the way up{3}those cliffs just to get that{3}mushroom for us?{2}
That's the nicest thing anyone{3}has ever done for me. I have{3}to thank you for this!{2}
But what could I have that a{3}warrior like you would want?{2}
That's a tricky one...{2}
I don't know if you want{3}a pet, but this is all we{3}can offer. Take care of it!{2}
{16} got{3}{18}{1}!{2}
I can't wait for dinner tonight.{3}Batter-fried mushrooms! Mmm!{2}
This here's enough of a{3}mushroom that we'll be{3}eating it for days!{2}
The more I think about dinner{3}tonight, the more I drool...{2}
These mushrooms will make{3}any meal taste amazing!{2}
No, dear... They look similar,{3}but these aren't quite right.{2}
Thanks for bringing this by,{3}but it's just not the type of{3}mushroom we like...{2}
Please... Won't you please{3}try to find the mushrooms{3}my husband loves so much?{2}
That mushroom was great,{3}but I ate way too much. I{3}don't ever want to see it again!{2}
Actually, I didn't cook the{3}mushrooms properly that night.{1}But, uh...please don't tell{3}my husband that.{2}
I don't remember mushrooms{3}like that ever tasting bad...{2}
If my husband finds out I{3}messed up the recipe, he'll{3}be so sad...{2}
Same sailors came through{3}recently with a ship similar{3}to {17}{8}'s.{1}I'd never seen one before,{3}but now they're everywhere.{3}Are they new?{2}
One of the sailors, {17}{1}, was{3}very curious about {17}{8}'s{3}ship. A little {9}{2}too{7} curious.{1}It looked like he had a{3}similar boat, almost identical{3}to {17}{8}'s.{2}
Oars, I understand. Hey,{3}I'll even give a sailboat{3}a try...{1}But there's no way I'm setting{3}foot on a ship powered by{3}some fool magic thingie.{2}
We've had a lot of strange{3}visitors ever since{3}{17}{8} showed up.{2}
Have you by chance seen{3}a girl named Menardi?{30}
You have? And... And you're telling{3}me that my sister is...dead?{30}
If you continue these lies, I{3}might take it upon myself to{3}shut you up. Get out of my sight!{2}
If you don't know my sister,{3}then I have nothing to say{3}to you. Get out of my sight!{2}
Using Psynergy on me?{3}Are you so dense that you{3}don't know when to be afraid?{2}
I don't have time to play{3}games with you. Now, leave{3}me to my thoughts!{2}
Where could Menardi have{3}gone? Where are you, my{3}sister?{2}
{17}{5}! You're back!{2}
And you've brought{3}{17}{8} with you!{2}
Oh! {17}{8}!{2}
{17}{8}, I must apologize for{3}the trouble we've caused you.{3}I'm sorry we lost your jewel...{2}
Don't be. Everything worked{3}out for the best.{2}
{17}{8}, you said you were{3}going to go to Gondowan.{3}Did you make it?{2}
Yes. In fact, we have{3}just returned.{2}
And your jewel...{30}
You actually got it back from{3}the Kibombo? Incredible...{2}
I was able to recover it{3}with the help of {17}{5}{3}and his friends.{2}
That's wonderful! I'm so relieved!{3}I was worried that you might{3}never get it back!{2}
You didn't recover it{3}from the Kibombo?{2}
That's not true, sir. {17}{5}{3}and his companions helped{3}me recover it.{2}
Please! Don't startle me like{3}that! I was afraid you might{3}never get it back!{2}
That's why we came back...{3}To let you know that we've{3}recovered it. Worry no more.{2}
Ah, so you'll be leaving{3}again, will you?{2}
Are you sure you must leave{3}so soon, {17}{8}?{2}
I may yet return here again, but{3}I'm afraid I must be going soon.{2}
You seem to be quite busy.{2}
It is their youth that allows{3}them to be so busy.{2}
But we'll be back, I promise.{3}Maybe we'll be able to visit{3}at a more leisurely pace...{2}
I'd like that...{2}
So would I!{2}
If you've already recovered{3}your jewel, why don't you{3}stay here for a bit longer?{2}
Unfortunately, we can't...{2}
Hey, have you seen{3}the girl out front?{2}
We must go...to the island{3}that is my home.{2}
{17}{8}, are you...{3}Are you sure?{2}
After what we've been{3}through, I feel I've learned{3}a few things.{2}
Like what!?{2}
Like...the fact that you{3}truly are good people.{2}
And that you have gone to{3}great lengths for no other{3}reason than to help those in need.{2}
I have come to realize that{3}I, too, must do something{3}to help where I can.{2}
{17}{8}...{2}
I have made my decision.{2}
And the sooner we depart,{3}the better, right, Kraden?{2}
We shall set sail, {17}{5}!{3}To my ship! To the Eastern Sea!{2}
Do you truly mean to leave{3}so soon, {17}{8}?{2}
I may yet again have reason{3}to visit your town, but...{3}yes, I must go.{2}
You seem quite busy.{2}
It is their youth that allows{3}them to be so busy.{2}
But we'll be back, I promise.{3}Maybe we'll be able to visit{3}at a more leisurely pace...{2}
I'd like that...{2}
So would I!{2}
I know you went to a lot of trouble{3}to get us that boat, but we just{3}had to give up on it.{1}We couldn't just sit and wait in{3}Alhafra until the thing got fixed.{2}
We just have to finish repairs{3}on that boat we left in Alhafra...{1}We've had several meetings{3}already, discussing our next{3}course of action.{2}
I'm so relieved {17}{8}{3}got his jewel back.{2}
I can't believe {17}{8}{3}actually went all the way to{3}Kibombo to get his jewel back.{1}That's so...dashing!{2}
Gondowan is such an{3}awful, dangerous place...{1}I never imagined for a second{3}that {17}{8} would make{3}it back here safely.{2}
I like you guys a lot. I'm{3}sad that you're leaving.{2}
My daddy went to Gondowan,{3}and all I got was nothing.{2}
All of this could have been avoided{3}if the people of Alhafra's offer to{3}repair the boat was genuine.{1}Now, I refuse to let that boat{3}fall into the hands of Alhafra{3}and its mayor.{2}
Why won't the mayor of{3}Alhafra repair our boat?{1}If we could get that ship,{3}Madra would embark on a{3}voyage to prosperity...{2}
I can't believe it... Despite all{3}my worrying, they got that{3}jewel back like it was nothing.{2}
I felt a little responsible for{3}{17}{8} losing his jewel.{3}I'm so happy he got it back!{2}
{17}{8} said he was going{3}to Gondowan alone, but now he{3}has some friends with him.{1}That's nice. If he'd been all{3}alone, I'm sure he would have{3}been eaten by monsters.{2}
I wish they'd tell me all{3}about their adventures!{2}
I'm so glad Daddy{3}got home safely.{2}
{17}{5}, wait!{2}
I believe I promised you{3}a reward for helping with{3}the boat, didn't I?{30}
Imagine! You came all this way{3}to put us at ease, and I totally{3}forget to give this to you!{2}
Well, you may have forgotten,{3}{17}{5}, but I have not.{2}
Regardless, I told you that I{3}would reward you when the{3}boat was fixed...{1}That may take quite a{3}while now, it seems...{2}
That being the case, I'd like{3}to give you that reward now.{2}
We can't accept it now,{3}though, could we, {17}{6}?{2}
Madra is still in shambles{3}from the disaster... We couldn't{3}possibly accept any gifts...{2}
Nonsense! Misfortune or no,{3}a promise is a promise!{2}
{16} got{3}{20}{2}.{2}
I am glad that I was able to{3}give it to you before you left.{2}
Your travels seem to take you{3}from danger into greater{3}danger. Please be careful.{2}
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.{2}
...{17}{5}?{2}
You... He just called you{3}{17}{5}, didn't he?{2}
Why didn't I see it before?{3}You are {17}{5}!{2}
Then Menardi should be{3}somewhere around here,{3}too... And yet...{2}
You won't see Menardi or{3}Saturos ever again.{3}{17}{1} killed them.{1}They're probably at the bottom{3}of the sea by now...{2}
{17}{7}! Quiet!{2}
Hmph! I heard that, you{3}wretched little thing!{2}
Can it be true? Is my{3}sister dead?{30}
No? Then where is she!?{3}Show me my sister!{2}
What is the matter? Is it so{3}very hard? You were traveling{3}with her{176}bring her to me!{2}
She would never have left{3}you behind...and yet you are{3}alone...{5} So it's true? She's...{2}
I can't believe it... No one has{3}the power to defeat Saturos{3}and my sister...{2}
Yet you all avoid my gaze...{3}And that look on your faces...{3}It...is true...{2}
Who is this {17}{1}?{2}
What? You feign ignorance?{3}Why? Would you protect him{3}from my fury!?{2}
Never mind. I believe I've heard{3}some rumors of a traveler{3}named {17}{1} lately.{2}
Is this {17}{1} the same{3}one they've been speaking of?{3}Is he pursuing you?{2}
If that is the case, then this{3}{17}{1} should show up{3}here sooner or later.{2}
How do you know it wasn't{3}{17}{5} who defeated{3}your sister?{2}
What do you take me for?{3}I'm a warrior, like my sister...{1}I can gauge a man's strength{3}at a single glance.{2}
Even if you doubled {17}{5}'s{3}power, he would still be no{3}match for my sister.{2}
And besides, I doubt {17}{5}{3}could find it in himself to{3}betray my sister.{2}
He knows that the lives of{3}those he holds dear would{3}hang in the balance.{2}
But I must congratulate you on{3}your successes at both the{3}Mercury and Venus Lighthouses.{2}
Although your success there{3}now prevents us from{3}returning to the Western Sea.{2}
You would have failed, of course,{3}had we not researched how to{3}climb those lighthouses...{2}
Oh, didn't Menardi tell you?{2}
Regardless, {17}{1} won't be{3}getting in my way.{2}
You will have to find your own{3}way to the Western Sea.{2}
And if you make the journey,{3}you'll have to light Jupiter on{3}your own as well!{2}
We have our own work to do,{3}and number one on the list is{3}taking care of {17}{1}!{1}Are we clear on this, {17}{5}?{30}
Aren't you an obedient boy...{3}If you're worried you can't get{3}it done, we could help you a bit.{2}
What's the matter? Afraid{3}you can't perform your duties?{3}We could help you a bit...{2}
No, thank you. I believe we'll{3}just find Jupiter Lighthouse on{3}our own, if it's all the same.{2}
I see. Just don't let{3}us down.{2}
We're going to find{3}that {17}{1}...{2}
I'm going to find this{3}{17}{1}...{1}And I swear that the last thing{3}he sees will be Karst avenging{3}the death of her dear sister!{2}
Wow. And I thought Saturos{3}and Menardi had issues.{2}
We shouldn't take Karst{3}too lightly...{2}
Wait a moment... Karst did say{3}"we," didn't she?{2}
Yes. Saturos and Menardi{3}traveled as a pair. Perhaps{3}she has a partner as well.{2}
We ought to warn {17}{1}{3}that Karst is after him. Maybe{3}we should try to find him first.{2}
Believe me, I'd love to see{3}{17}{1} again, but we just don't{3}have time to look for him. Plus...{2}
Even if we did find them, I{3}think there is a good chance{3}we'd end up fighting them.{2}
Why?{2}
What we are trying to achieve,{3}they are trying to prevent...{3}And they will fight to stop us.{2}
But, {17}{6}... Aren't you and{3}{17}{1} an item? Couldn't{3}you, you know, do something?{2}
A... An item? No! I mean...{3}It's not like that! Not...really...{2}
...Stupid {17}{7}...{2}
Ah! Well! Er, yes. For now, we{3}should press onward to Jupiter{3}Lighthouse, like we'd planned.{2}
But...what about {17}{2}{3}and the others?{2}
Don't you mean...{17}{1}?{2}
{17}{7}! Be quiet! Sheesh...{2}
*Ahem!* Are you ready{3}to listen yet?{2}
They were strong enough to{3}defeat Saturos and Menardi.{3}They won't be beaten easily.{2}
We should continue on ahead,{3}just as Saturos and Menardi{3}would have, OK, {17}{6}?{2}
{17}{7}? {17}{8}?{3}Are you ready?{2}
Then we should be going,{3}right, {17}{5}?{2}
Oh! {17}{8}! After the way{3}we treated you, I thought you'd{3}never come to Madra again!{1}I know we were not very nice{3}to you before... I hope you can{3}forgive us.{2}
Shin's developed a terrible{3}fear of the cold. He's afraid of{3}being turned into a block of ice.{1}Tell {17}{8} to cool it{3}with the ice routine, OK?{2}
Even the sound of the name{3}"{17}{8}" sends a chill{3}down my spine.{2}
I understand why Shin's scared{3}of {17}{8}, but I think{3}he might be overdoing it.{2}
It looks like the Kibombo must{3}have been involved in the raids{3}on our town...{1}Kibombo weapons are too{3}distinct... We found a bunch{3}of them after the attacks.{2}
The pirates and the Kibombo{3}must have been working together.{3}What an astounding discovery!{2}
People are saying the Champa{3}and the Kibombo formed an{3}alliance... I don't buy it, myself.{2}
That night, the Champa came from{3}the east, and the Kibombo, from{3}the west. That's not an alliance.{2}
My boyfriend, Shin, seems so{3}downtrodden lately...{3}I hope he's all right.{2}
I've told my sister not to{3}worry about Shin. He's tough.{3}At least...he usually is...{2}
Shin seems terrified of{3}{17}{8}. I wonder what{3}happened between them.{1}Still, I guess that explains{3}why he's been so on edge{3}lately.{2}
Shin's normally so kind and{3}gentle. I hope he gets over{3}whatever's bothering him.{2}
I've noticed lately that the{3}temperature of the ocean has{3}been slowly rising.{1}It is a bad omen, I say.{3}Be wary if you plan to{3}set sail soon.{2}
The ocean's been warming up{3}a lot, and we're seeing lots of{3}dead fish washing up on shore.{1}At this rate, there aren't going{3}to be any fish left for us to{3}catch for food.{2}
When the ocean warms, the{3}Eastern Sea beckons... Seek for{3}the center, the legends say.{1}These legends are known to{3}nearly every sailor. It would be{3}wise for you to remember it, too.{2}
I knew the temperatures were{3}rising slowly over time...{1}But now, it's plain to see that{3}the temperatures are rising at{3}a dramatically higher rate.{2}
Our new ship is spectacular, but{3}if we can't find some new fishing{3}spots, it does us no good at all.{1}Tidal waves, raids on our town,{3}and now the warming ocean{3}waters... What's going on?{2}
Seafaring towns know many{3}more legends of the sea...{1}But a few of the sailors passing{3}through here have told their{3}share of stories of the salty sea.{2}
Are you worried about all the{3}fish that have been washing{3}up dead on the shore?{30}
No need to worry. Those fish{3}all died farther out in the bay.{1}The fish we cook here at{3}the inn are caught fresh{3}from our pier.{2}
No?! I suppose you'd be happy{3}if the fish up and vanished, huh?{1}They're dying because the ocean{3}temperatures are rising, but no{3}one is doing anything about it...{2}
Has someone been telling you{3}that we've been serving up the{3}dead fish found on the beaches?{1}Outrageous! We go to great pains{3}to serve only the finest fresh{3}fish to our customers.{2}
One of our guests kept asking{3}for a weapon that he could use{3}to slay a great sea monster...{1}He kept mentioning this trident{3}thing, but we couldn't help him.{2}
I guess that a lot of dead{3}fish have been washing ashore{3}all over the eastern seacoast.{1}It's kind of sad... Imagine how{3}much money we could have{3}made if we'd caught them.{2}
I've heard that rising ocean{3}temperatures mean that a{3}volcano is forming under the sea.{2}
I've never seen a single customer{3}get sick from our fish! Not a{3}single one...{1}I've never served rotten old fish{3}in my life! I only use the finest,{3}freshest ingredients in my cuisine.{2}
Someone must have seen me{3}burying the dead fish. I'll bet{3}that's where the rumor started.{2}
It must be a very strange{3}monster if one needs such{3}a unique weapon to fight it.{2}
If I had a boat we could{3}use, now would be a great{3}time to make some money.{1}We'd just need to take our{3}nets and scoop up whatever{3}we find...{2}
Hm... I wonder if the tidal{3}wave might have been caused{3}by an undersea eruption...{2}
My ship! At long last...{3}I have returned to my ship.{2}
Well, {17}{8}?{2}
I'm thrilled... I'm just happy{3}to be back with my ship.{2}
Uh, that's not what{3}Kraden's asking...{2}
You forgot, didn't you, {17}{8}?{3}When we talked in Kibombo?{3}Remember what Kraden asked?{2}
He wanted you to take us{3}to your home... To Lemuria.{2}
Remember how we said we'd{3}talk about it later?{3}Well, it's later now, {17}{8}.{2}
Oh... Is it? I suppose we have{3}to talk about it sooner or later.{3}You shall have your answer.{2}
{17}{8}...if you do not{3}wish to take us, you do not have{3}to. Just tell me honestly.{2}
And if not, well, we'll just have{3}to get ourselves a boat and find{3}our own way to Lemuria.{2}
Right, {17}{5}?{30}
What's with the guilt trip?{3}{17}{8} hasn't even given{3}us his answer yet!{2}
Kraden! {17}{5}! Stop trying{3}to pressure {17}{8}!{2}
{17}{7} is right! You guys{3}just let {17}{8} give{3}us his answer!{2}
I agree with {17}{5}. We{3}shouldn't try to pressure{3}{17}{8}, Kraden.{2}
But that's not what I was{176}{2}
Don't worry, {17}{7}...{3}I've actually been thinking{3}about this quite a bit.{2}
I just never got the opportunity{3}to mention it before.{2}
Well? Well!?{2}
It's not nice to test the{3}patience of an old man.{3}Will you take us or not?{2}
We will go to Lemuria, Kraden.{2}
I figured it was too much to...{2}
What did you just say!?{2}
I will take you to Lemuria.{2}
Kraden? Are you OK?{2}
Is he OK!?{2}
{17}{8}! Are you...{3}Are you serious?{2}
After what we've been through,{3}it would be wrong to deny you.{3}That's what made up my mind.{2}
What's what made up your mind?{2}
The fact that you are{3}truly good people.{2}
You have gone to great trouble{3}to help one whose problems{3}needn't have concerned you...{2}
Witnessing that kindness...{3}It made me want to help, too.{2}
{17}{8}, you...{2}
No, {17}{6}. Please, don't say{3}a word. I've made up my mind.{2}
I shall be leaving immediately,{3}but I want you to come, Kraden.{2}
Let us set sail, {17}{5}!{3}To my ship! And the Eastern Sea!{2}
So at long last, I will finally{3}reach Lemuria...{2}
I wonder what kind of advanced{3}civilization we'll find in Lemuria...{2}
I'm actually excited to find out!{2}
What's wrong, {17}{8}?{2}
It just occurred to me... The{3}mayor of Madra and his wife{3}must be worried about me.{1}I'd feel bad if I didn't let{3}them know I was all right{3}before leaving Indra.{2}
We should go tell them that{3}I've retrieved my orb. Then{3}they wouldn't have to worry.{2}
Is that acceptable, {17}{5}?{3}Can we stop by Madra briefly{3}before we leave for Lemuria?{2}
What do you say, {17}{5}?{3}Shall we go see the mayor?{30}
Don't worry about me. I've waited{3}this long. I can wait a little longer.{3}Let's go see the mayor!{2}
I have no objection, so why{3}not? Let's go.{2}
But we must depart as soon{3}as we're done at the mayor's{3}house, {17}{8}.{2}
Oh, thank you!{2}
Then let's waste no time!{3}We should set out for{3}Madra at once!{2}
At last, I'm back on my ship.{2}
Finally, I can return to{3}my beloved Lemuria.{2}
Wait there a moment.{2}
To set sail, we must{3}go down to the power{3}chamber belowdecks.{2}
Let's head down.{2}
How did all these monsters{3}get on board? I could swear I{3}locked the door when I left...{2}
It doesn't matter. Once we get{3}this ship moving, I'm sure they'll{3}all jump ship.{2}
OK, now, I must set the{3}black orb in this pedestal.{2}
Take the tiller, {17}{5}!{2}
?!?{2}
If you hope to reach Lemuria,{3}you'll have to learn a few{3}things about handling a ship.{1}I think we ought to sail{3}the Eastern Sea until you{3}get the hang of it.{2}
Kraden, shouldn't we be heading{3}straight for Lemuria?{2}
Well, I suppose if we have to{3}learn to sail, it's better to do{3}it sooner than later...{2}
Then I want to go to Lalivero!{3}And Tolbi!{5} Oh! And Vale!{3}Can we go to Vale?{2}
I'd love to see your hometown,{3}{17}{6}! Shall we? Let's{3}do it! To Vale we go!{30}
I don't think that's a good idea.{2}
I'm with {17}{5}.{3}I don't think that would be{3}a wise course of action.{2}
Come, now! Why not?{2}
Think about the roads we have{3}traveled to get where we are...{2}
I can't... I was never any{3}good at geography.{2}
Then allow me to explain...{1}The coastline of Angara, the{3}continent in which Vale lies,{3}is surrounded by rocky cliffs.{2}
Oh... You don't think {17}{8}'s{3}boat could land there?{2}
And as for Gondowan, I would{3}guess the people from Lalivero{3}are...looking for us.{2}
He's right. Saturos and Menardi{3}went a little wild in Lalivero,{3}and you were all with them.{2}
Oh... But {17}{7} can explain{3}the situation for us.{1}Faran and the Laliverans{3}would understand, I'm sure.{2}
And then they'd make me stay{3}in Lalivero! Would you just leave{3}me there, {17}{5}?{2}
Oh yeah... Maybe that wouldn't be{3}such a good idea after all...{2}
Then it's decided!{2}
What's decided?{2}
The sea is vast... We can go{3}wherever we please! So, let's{3}explore a bit, {17}{5}!{2}
That's a great idea! We've{3}already met werewolves and{3}discovered new Psynergy.{1}I'm sure there's even more{3}out there waiting for us{3}to find it!{2}
Wow! This is going to be great!{2}
Hmm... The seas can be quite{3}dangerous. It won't be my fault{3}if something happens, Kraden.{2}
To the open sea, {17}{5}!{2}
There's no reaction...{3}It doesn't seem to be running.{2}
The mayor tried to give {17}{5}{3}{20}{2}, but {17}{5} can't{3}carry any more items.{2}
I couldn't possibly allow you to{3}leave with out giving you the{3}reward I promised.{2}
The mayor put the {20}{1}{3}in a pot.{2}
I'll put it in here. You can{3}come pick it up anytime.{2}
Rocks are poking out above{3}the waves. Pass them with care...{2}
These shoals would not make{3}a good place to land.{2}
Ever since the tidal wave moved{3}Indra, we haven't been able to go{3}to Gondowan's western shores.{2}
Did you know Indra moved?{3}It was quite a shock to all{3}of us here...{1}We haven't been able to use{3}the waterways to the south{3}ever since.{2}
My pop's the best sailor in{3}all the Eastern Sea!{1}That's why he can go anywhere,{3}even in that tiny boat of his!{2}
You're lucky, mister. You get to{3}ride your boat out on the open{3}sea all you want...{1}My dad'll be done with his boat{3}soon, and together, we'll be able{3}to sail anywhere we want...{2}
The waterways north of Tundaria{3}would have been the perfect{3}place to teach my sons to sail...{2}
I'm so grateful our little island{3}wasn't damaged in the tidal{3}wave... It was a miracle.{2}
I can't wait until Dad teaches{3}me how to sail...{2}
I can't wait until the day{3}I can sail far away with{3}Dad and Kirt...{2}
Used to be, you could sail to{3}the other side of Gondowan by{3}skirting the coast of Tundaria.{1}Now, the whole area's got these{3}rocky spires... You just can't{3}work a boat around 'em.{2}
You must be cold, dressed in{3}those thin clothes... Come warm{3}yourselves by the fire...{2}
My mom says there's this{3}strange tower on the northern{3}cape of Tundaria.{2}
Tundaria is the southernmost{3}continent in Weyard. I hear that{3}if you head east far enough...{1}There's an incredible waterfall{3}at the edge of the Easten Sea.{3}It sounds like hokum to me.{2}
Around here, it doesn't matter{3}what season it is...{3}It's always the cold season.{1}I can't even go outside without{3}first covering myself in fur.{2}
Who in Weyard would have{3}built a tower in the middle{3}of that frozen nowhere?{2}
I just want to know what's on{3}the other side of that sea{3}of fog...{1}No one has ever crossed{3}through it, but one day, I just{3}know I'll do it!{2}
The Sea of Time... A massive bank{3}of fog that lies over the sea... All{3}sailors fear it, and rightly so!{1}I don't know if I'll ever make it{3}through, but I'm certain my son{3}will do it someday.{2}
Sailors tell of terrible currents{3}and vortexes that can tear a{3}boat to shreds in the Sea of Time.{2}
When you enter the sea of fog...{3}enter the currents from the{3}direction of the red rocks.{1}Then, your ship won't be{3}destroyed.{5} But that's all I know.{3}And it might not even be right!{2}
Ours is sad lineage...{1}Three generations of sons{3}have sworn their lives to trying{3}to pass through the sea of fog.{2}
Dad and Grandpa haven't been{3}able to cross the Sea of Time.{3}They're so old now...{1}I will be the one to make{3}their dreams come true.{2}
I remember once, an entire fleet{3}of ships entered the Sea of Time.{3}They vanished into the mists.{1}Every last one of the vessels{3}was destroyed by the currents.{2}
Once, long ago, my husband{3}entered the Sea of Time{3}without being destroyed.{1}The whirlpools spun him around,{3}and he got so dizzy he couldn't{3}stand. I wonder if he remembers.{2}
I didn't really discover the{3}secret of the red rocks...{1}It was Yepp, the great explorer{3}from Yallam, who told me.{3}I should fess up.{2}
And just what will happen once{3}they get through the sea of fog?{3}I wish they would just give up.{2}
We like this island. A lot...{3}That's why we're here...{3}Because we like it.{1}We sure aren't looking{3}for Treasure Isle! Nope!{2}
What are you saying!? Idiot!{2}
Don't listen to that guy. He{3}didn't say anything about{3}Treasure Isle. Nothing at all.{2}
Look, we're busy...{3}We can't talk now...{3}Catch us some other time...{2}
...{2}
The Eastern Sea is huge, even{3}if you don't add the Sea of Time,{3}which I guess you've got to do.{2}
You don't look like much of a{3}sailor. You're not a treasure{3}hunter, are you?{1}Because you won't find any{3}in the waters around here, let{3}me tell you!{2}
If we're supposed to be partners{3}in this crazy treasure hunt, why{3}am I the one doing all the cooking?{2}
Sure, there are legends about{3}how there's treasure hidden{3}north of the Sea of Time.{1}But have WE found any?{3}I just hope it's not on the sea-{3}floor! What would we do then?{2}
You used to be able to dive{3}into the ocean and find all{3}sorts of treasure in the reefs.{1}I liked to think all that stuff{3}was a gift from the deep...{3}A gift for me!{2}
The temperature of the ocean{3}has been rising. The waters{3}are hottest at the Sea of Time.{1}I sure hope Poseidon hasn't{3}surfaced again! He was once a{3}king, but now, he's a monster!{2}
I remember how we used to{3}dredge up treasure by looking{3}for shadows in the reefs...{2}
Long ago, Poseidon ruled{3}over all the oceans as the{3}one true king of the sea.{1}Legends say the only way to{3}defeat him is to stab him{3}with a trident...{2}
Pen pen!{2}
Pen pen pehnnn!{2}
My darling Pengulina hurt{3}her leg on the far shore and{3}can't swim back.{1}Somebody, please... Help her!{2}
Ohh... My leg... I can't get{3}back to my dearest Pengus...{2}
Thank you so much for saving{3}my sweet Pengulina.{1}Allow me to give you this{3}in return for your help.{2}
{17}{5} got a beautiful stone{3}from Pengus as a reward for{3}saving dear little Pengulina.{2}
Pen pen.{2}
Pen pen pehnnn.{2}
I'm so happy my lovely{3}little Pengulina is all right.{2}
I'm so glad to be back on{3}this side again, with my{3}precious Pengus.{2}
Pen pen pen...{2}
Pen pen pehnnnn.{2}
There is nothing better than{3}spending a day playing in the{3}snow with my pretty Pengulina.{2}
Pengus is pretty pleasant, and{3}I like that he likes me...{1}But he's always chasing me{3}around! I feel like I'm being{3}smothered...and I don't like it!{2}
Chirp chirp!{2}
I love feeling fancy! I want{3}a really fancy accessory{3}to make me feel extra fancy!{2}
Oh my! That stone you have!{3}It's divine! Simply divine!{1}I must have it! MUST! I'll give{3}you my very fancy neckerchief{3}for that fancy stone of yours!{2}
{17}{5} traded his stone{3}for the very fancy neckerchief.{2}
Chirp chirp!{2}
What do you think? Don't I{3}look fancy? I sure feel fancy!{3}And that's all that matters!{1}But I think this looks{3}fabulous on me! I love{3}fancy accessories!{2}
Moo! Moo!{2}
I've been feeling so low{3}lately... I long to feel the{3}utter joy of...something.{1}I just don't know what.{2}
Oh! That red neckerchief{3}is quite nice indeed.{3}That would lift my spirits.{2}
This really brightens{3}my mooood!{2}
{17}{5} tied the neckerchief{3}to the tree.{2}
Are you giving that lovely{3}thing to moooooi?{2}
That's so kind of you! I should{3}repay you! Have some milk!{2}
{17}{5} traded the red neckerchief{3}for some fresh milk.{2}
Yup. A nice, red neckerchief{3}will never steer you wrong!{2}
I'm sorry to hear that.{3}Come see me if you{3}don't want it anymore.{2}
Are you giving that red{3}neckerchief to moooooi?{2}
Arff! Arff!{2}
The water here is so salty!{3}I wish someone would bring{3}me something tasty to drink.{2}
Sniff! Sniff! I smell fresh milk!{2}
Hah hah hah! Are you going{3}to give me that milk? Are{3}you? Huh? Huh!?{1}I'll trade you this for it!{3}I caught it myself!{2}
{17}{5} traded his milk{3}for the dog's turtle!{2}
I don't like to waste. I'll{3}just take little tiny laps.{2}
I don't want to waste, so{3}I'm just taking little laps.{2}
...{2}
I'm so very...very lonely.{3}I could sure use a friend.{2}
I'm so very sad and lonely.{3}I wish I had a friend to{3}call my own...{2}
Hey! You've got an itty-{3}bitty turtle tot, don't you?{2}
Why don't you set that{3}li'l guy free with me?{2}
No? Oh... Then lonely I shall stay.{3}But if you change your mind,{3}you know where to find me.{2}
Oh! You're really going to let{3}me take care of your li'l turtle?{2}
At long last, I have a friend!{3}Lonesome George I am no more!{3}I'm so happy!{2}
I don't have much to offer in{3}return, but I can show you...{3}my secret spot.{2}
Hop on my back!{2}
And we're off!{2}
Well, here we are.{2}
When you want to go back to{3}the island, just let me know.{2}
Yup!{2}
You all set to go back{3}to the island?{30}
Then back we go!{2}
Here we are!{2}
If you want to go to my secret{3}spot again, just let me know.{2}
Take your time! I don't{3}like to rush...{2}
Yup!{2}
Want to go to my{3}secret spot again?{2}
Anytime you want me to{3}take you to my secret spot,{3}just say the word.{2}
Then hop on my back!{2}
And we're off!{2}
Well, here we are.{2}
When you want to go back to{3}the island, just let me know.{2}
Yup!{2}
You all set to go back{3}to the island?{2}
Then back we go!{2}
Here we are!{2}
If you want to go to my secret{3}spot again, just let me know.{2}
Take your time! I don't{3}like to rush...{2}
I am here to tend to any travelers{3}who come to this place.{2}
May these travelers' journey{3}end in peace and safety...{2}
Yallam doesn't get many{3}visitors. Hasn't for a long time.{1}I'd love to know a little about{3}what's going on in the outside{3}world.{2}
Our master boatsman, Yepp, died.{3}Now, all we have to remember{3}him are the songs he wrote.{2}
If Yepp were alive today, our{3}village would be thriving. He{3}brought us lots of work.{2}
Yepp found this huge bed of pearls{3}and sold them in another town.{1}Then, he bought all kinds of{3}things we needed in Yallam.{2}
There used to be a lot of{3}pearl divers here in Yallam. I{3}used to do some diving myself!{1}Yup... They were all younger{3}than me, but I still gave 'em{3}a good run for the money.{2}
When we lost Yepp, all of{3}Yallam practically fell to pieces.{1}Our blacksmith, Sunshine, is our{3}only claim to fame now... He's{3}the best in all the lands...{2}
Yepp was the one who taught{3}me how to handle a boat.{3}That was right before he died...{1}He'd promised to teach me{3}how to dive for pearls...{3}Poor Yepp. I really miss him.{2}
Yepp told me the only thing{3}he could teach me was how{3}to sail and how to sing.{2}
Yepp was the one who{3}visited the lands beyond{3}eastern Osenia.{1}Since he died, we've had{3}no news from the outside{3}world at all.{2}
Singing with Yepp and all the{3}children in the village helped{3}us remember the songs.{1}It's funny how we all{3}memorized every one{3}of Yepp's songs.{2}
Those pearls Yepp brought back{3}from the sea were the most{3}marvelous things I've ever seen.{1}If he were still with us,{3}Yallam wouldn't be in this{3}terrible fix.{2}
Yepp never told any of{3}us where he found his{3}bed of pearls, but...{1}I suspect it's somewhere{3}near the center of the Eastern{3}Sea. He knew that area well.{2}
Yepp was amazing. He could{3}cut clean through the Sea of{3}Time with utter ease.{1}He read those waves like no{3}other sailor on Weyard. He{3}was a true man of the sea.{2}
Sunshine is a famous{3}blacksmith... The most{3}famous in Osenia...{2}
I've searched the seas from{3}north to south, and I just can't{3}find those pearls...{1}I wonder if the pearls from his{3}secret place are all gone...{2}
Yepp always sang such{3}wonderful children's songs{3}whenever he played with them.{2}
Yepp had three different songs{3}he used to sing. Each song{3}was about a different situation.{2}
Do you like children's songs?{30}
Hmmm... Well, I don't care for{3}them so much, myself.{1}I mean, the lyrics make no{3}sense! ...And that stupid dance{3}we have to do when we sing!!{2}
Yeah, you're totally right.{3}I just hate those songs.{1}One of these days, I'll{3}write one, and it'll be so{3}much better than this!{2}
The songs are supposed to mean{3}something, but none of the other{3}kids knows what...{2}
I wonder why Yepp wanted{3}the children to learn those{3}songs he used to sing...{2}
It's been really dry the past{3}few months. Even Taopo{3}Swamp has dried up.{2}
We're supposed to be right in{3}the middle of the rainy season,{3}but I don't see any rain...{2}
When Taopo Swamp dries up,{3}we're in for some serious{3}drought problems this year.{2}
I can't stand this drought!{3}How long is the weather{3}going to be like this?{2}
Sunshine has started complaining{3}that he can't work lately. He{3}blames it on the lack of rain.{2}
Our blacksmith, Sunshine, makes{3}the kinds of items you can't{3}find anywhere else.{1}You wouldn't know it to look{3}at him...or to talk to him...but{3}he's an amazing worker...{2}
What kind of person only wants{3}to work when it's raining?{1}I know Sunshine likes to enjoy{3}his days off, but he needs to{3}find a better excuse not to work.{2}
Sunshine's a little eccentric. He{3}disappears into Taopo Swamp{3}for days at a time...{2}
If the blacksmith isn't willing to{3}work, then how am I supposed{3}to get fine weapons to sell?{2}
If Sunshine set his mind to it,{3}he could make a lot of money!{3}What a waste of talent...{2}
If you want plain old, boring{3}armor, have a look around.{1}If you're looking for some{3}of Sunshine's work, you'll{3}have to come back later.{2}
I shouldn't tell him how boring{3}all this stuff is. I wish Sunshine{3}would get back to work!{2}
If you're looking for Taopo{3}Swamp, head west around{3}the northern mountain range.{1}Sunshine sometimes goes{3}up there by himself on long{3}trips. It's a dangerous place.{2}
What does Sunshine want{3}in Taopo Swamp?{1}There's nothing up there{3}but bugs and some odd{3}mountain fish.{2}
It's a bit strange trying to{3}run an inn in a city that{3}never gets tourists, isn't it?{1}Well, sometimes, the locals{3}like to stay here. It's like a{3}little vacation for them, I guess.{2}
Taopo Swamp has dried up, and{3}now it's inaccessible.{1}What's worse, with no water,{3}we can no longer get any more{3}delicious Yallam mountain fish.{2}
Yallam was always such a{3}poor town. We had to work{3}hard just to break even.{2}
There weren't a lot of mountain{3}fish after the swamp dried up.{3}We probably won't catch many.{2}
Even out in these far-off{3}shores, people need the{3}services and hope I bring.{1}I am grateful merely to have{3}the chance to bring them{3}some small relief.{2}
Once, this was a thriving village.{3}Now, I look around, and I only{3}see abject poverty and despair.{2}
Ah, so you want me to make{3}you a little something special?{30}
Listen, when the sun's shining,{3}that's "me time." I only work{3}when it's raining, you get me?{2}
Oh, that's good. It's a bright,{3}sunshiny day, so I'm not doing{3}any work. Not till it rains.{1}But listen, I'm not just slacking{3}off because it's a nice day. I can{3}only work in the rain! Really!{2}
This is Sunshine's house. He's the{3}local blacksmith.{1}I'm afraid he's not taking on{3}any jobs right now, though.{3}He's just not...{2}
Dad's not doing any work right{3}now, but I'm making some basic{3}things for the villagers.{1}Maybe someday, I'll be able to{3}smith unique weapons, like my{3}dad. That's why I keep practicing!{2}
If it's not raining, I can't get{3}into Taopo Swamp.{1}And if I can't get to Taopo, then{3}I can't get the stuff I need to{3}work, so there's no point!{2}
Sunshine's a pretty stubborn guy.{3}If he says he isn't going to{3}work, then he's not gonna work.{2}
Everyone thinks Dad is stubborn,{3}but he's not...{1}He's a true artist, and so what{3}if he gets a little temperamental{3}from time to time?{2}
Hey, where did you get your{3}hands on those materials?{2}
Well, it doesn't really{3}matter, now does it?{2}
Looking at those raw materials{3}you've got there gives me a{3}mean hunger to do some smithing!{2}
I handed him the {20}{1}.{2}
Wait until you see what I'm{3}going to make for you!{3}You'll be amazed. Seriously.{2}
I can't wait to see what I'm{3}going to wind up making with{3}this...{1}It's funny, but I never know{3}until I actually start working! I'm{3}sure you'll be happy with it!{2}
It takes our Sunshine a long{3}time to finish the items he{3}works on.{1}Maybe you could just...wait{3}a little while before coming{3}to pick it up...{2}
It's so weird, but something{3}really inspired my father to{3}work! He's beaming with joy!{2}
It's been a long time since{3}I've been able to work. I'm so{3}excited! What should I make?{2}
What happened to Sunshine?{3}He's so happy, and he just{3}talks about work all the time!{2}
Now that my dad's working again,{3}I have to watch his every move{3}to see what I can learn from him.{2}
You want the item I made{3}with your raw materials?{3}Sure, sure...{1}My wife has it. She can{3}give it to you.{2}
I've got the item you ordered.{1}Now, about the payment... We{3}only take cash. I hope that's not{3}a problem. Do you have enough?{30}
Hey, we're not a charity! If{3}you don't have the money,{3}you don't get the item!{2}
Right. Your {20}{1} will{3}come to {18}{1} coin{25}.{2}
Hey, you don't enough money!{3}What are you trying to pull!?{3}I can't give you this!{2}
OK, here you go!{2}
You got the {20}{1}!{2}
Man, if Sunshine worked more,{3}we'd be wealthy! What a{3}waste of a great talent...{2}
My dad's work is just insane!{3}It'll take me years to be{3}that good!{2}
Do you want to hear one of{3}the songs Yepp wrote?{30}
This is where all the kids{3}in Yallam come to play...{1}Nobody complains when we{3}play around out here...{2}
Running around in circles{3}here while singing one of{3}Yepp's songs is pretty tough.{2}
There's a game that goes along{3}with the song, but it's tough. I{3}want to play something else.{2}
Yepp wrote all of his children's{3}songs while he was out here{3}in his own private space.{2}
Yepp's songs are a lot of fun,{3}because he made this game{3}that goes along with them...{2}
There's a lot of stuff to remember{3}for each song. It's tough to play{3}without making any mistakes.{2}
I once heard that children's{3}songs and stories have{3}hidden meanings.{1}I wonder if Yepp has hidden{3}anything in his songs...{2}
The story is that all these objects{3}around here were brought here{3}by Yepp long, long ago.{1}If you look around, you'll see{3}that everything was arranged{3}in accordance with his songs...{2}
Here, let me show you!{2}
Try turning the wooden pole{3}sticking out of that stone.{2}
I thought I saw something{3}sparkling in the ground!{2}
Hey, why don't you play with{3}us while we sing Yepp's song!{2}
This is where all the kids{3}in Yallam come to play...{1}Nobody complains when we{3}play around out here...{2}
Running in circles and singing{3}that song makes me feel all{3}dizzy in the head.{2}
There's a game that goes along{3}with the song, but it's tough. I{3}want to play something else.{2}
Yepp wrote all of his children's{3}songs while he was out here{3}in his own private space.{2}
Yepp's songs are a lot of fun,{3}because he made this game{3}that goes along with them...{2}
There's a lot of stuff to remember{3}for each song. It's tough to play{3}without making any mistakes.{2}
I once heard that children's{3}songs and stories have{3}hidden meanings.{1}I wonder if Yepp has hidden{3}anything in his songs...{2}
The story is that all these objects{3}around here were brought here{3}by Yepp long, long ago.{1}If you look around, you'll see{3}that everything was arranged{3}in accordance with his songs...{2}
Here, let me show you!{2}
If you want to go to the stars,{3}if you want to go to the stars.{2}
Go north past the twins,{3}passing two swirls, run{3}deasil twice 'round the trunk.{2}
Haste without waste, and head to{3}the east, past three to the north.{2}
There, run 'round thrice and wait{3}for the waves. When they stop,{3}run north and go to the stars.{2}
If you race full of folly and{3}take the wrong way, you'll{3}find yourself a watery grave.{2}
Do you wanna hear the second{3}children's song Yepp wrote?{30}
Well, that's just fine then. Give{3}me a holler if you ever do.{2}
If you want to go to the moon,{3}if you want to go to the moon.{2}
Face west from the stars and{3}run straight past three swirls,{3}then circle 'round twice.{2}
Haste without waste, and head to{3}the south, then one swirl west.{2}
There, run 'round thrice and wait{3}for the waves. When they stop,{3}run south and go for the moon.{2}
If you race full of folly and{3}take the wrong way, you'll{3}find yourself a watery grave.{2}
OK, so, now do you want to{3}hear the third children's song?{30}
Well, that's just fine then. Give{3}me a holler if you ever do.{2}
If you want to go to the sun,{3}if you want to go to the sun.{2}
Face south from the moon{3}and run straight through two{3}swirls, then circle 'round twice.{2}
Haste without waste, and head to{3}the west, then six to the north.{2}
There, run 'round thrice and wait{3}for the waves. When they stop,{3}run north and go for the sun.{2}
If you race full of folly and{3}take the wrong way, you'll{3}find yourself a watery grave.{2}
That's it. That's all the games{3}we have for the songs...{1}If you want to play some{3}more, just give me a holler.{2}
This is Apojii, the easternmost{3}island in the Eastern Sea!{1}Wherever you're from, you've{3}come a long way. You must{3}be here to see Gaia Falls!{2}
Whatever you do, don't sail{3}out to the eastern edge{3}of the sea...{1}That's where the world ends.{3}No one knows where the falls{3}go, but you won't come back!{2}
The huge waterfall at the{3}edge of the world is known{3}as Gaia Falls.{2}
On Aqua Island, you can see{3}the guardian moai.{1}Because of the moai, no one{3}can climb the craggy mountain.{2}
Have you any idea what it's like{3}living on the edge of the world?{3}One wrong step, and down you go!{2}
I don't know what brings you{3}to Apojii, but you'd better not{3}be planning anything stupid.{2}
When they come of age,{3}all the men of Apojii go{3}to Aqua Island. Will I, too?{2}
Do you think if you fall off{3}of Gaia Falls that you keep{3}on falling forever and ever?{2}
If there's nothing on Aqua{3}Island, then what are those{3}moai guarding, anyway?{2}
Looking over Gaia Falls{3}really makes you feel{3}small and insignificant.{2}
The currents near Apojii run{3}swiftly because we're so near{3}to Gaia Falls.{2}
All of the ocean's water is{3}spilling over Gaia Falls... Where{3}does it all go?{1}And more importantly, what{3}happens when all the water's{3}gone over the edge?{2}
Why would anyone build{3}a guardian statue out on{3}Aqua Island? What's to guard?{2}
Well, at least Gaia Falls will{3}put an end to a few silly{3}arguments.{1}After all, if it's got an edge{3}and you can fall off it, the{3}world is clearly FLAT!{2}
Apojii has so many nice{3}sights... Gaia Falls to the east,{3}and Aqua Island to the south.{2}
Aqua Island is supposed to{3}be dangerous, but that's why{3}I want to go!{2}
I wonder where I'd be if I{3}fell off Gaia Falls...{1}I'd like to know, but I don't{3}want to find out firsthand!{2}
Aqua Rock must be the secret{3}hidden on Aqua Island. One day,{3}I'll have to scale its peak.{2}
What...{3}What just happened?{2}
That rock couldn't have heard{3}my wishes... That's impossible!{2}
It's got to be.{2}
Well, OK then... Maybe we should{3}try putting some more of our{3}wishes into the rock.{2}
There's this guy in town who{3}spends his time at the spring,{3}staring at the Aqua Stone.{2}
Why does my father keep{3}staring at that rock every day?{2}
I just wish he'd spend{3}some time at home. I'm{3}fed up with his nonsense!{2}
I can't ever tell what kind{3}of mood Mom and Dad are{3}in. At least they're not fighting.{2}
I absolutely refuse to let{3}my son swim in the ocean{3}until he is an adult.{2}
The currents around Apojii{3}are just too strong to let{3}children swim on their own.{1}They're too strong for a lot{3}of the adults, too... They can{3}just wash a person away!{2}
I'm not allowed to go{3}into the ocean.{2}
Hey, mister! Did you know{3}that all the kids are calling{3}you their hero?{2}
I sink like a rock. It always{3}embarrasses my son to see{3}me try to swim.{1}I'm afraid he's no better than{3}I am, but he still wants to{3}practice and get better!{2}
Poor boy... His father sinks like{3}a rock, and I know it's genetic.{3}So he's not allowed to swim!{2}
It's stupid that I'm not{3}allowed to swim just because{3}Dad doesn't know how...{1}Someday, I'll show him...{3}I'll show them all!{2}
Wow! He swam in the ocean{3}and survived the currents!{3}And he's looking at me!{2}
That old Aqua Stone is{3}supposed to be the key to{3}getting onto Aqua Island.{2}
He's too old to try now,{3}but my husband used to{3}dream of scaling Aqua Rock.{2}
You unlock the Aqua Stone by{3}making it damp, but splashing{3}springwater on it won't work.{2}
He always wanted to climb{3}to the peak of the mountain{3}on Aqua Island.{1}But he spent all his time{3}studying that Aqua Stone{3}instead. I always wondered why.{2}
It'd be nice if we could{3}import some items that{3}our visitors would like.{2}
No one ships to Garapas so{3}I wonder if wares are scarce.{1}On the other hand, I suppose some{3}wares are unique to Garapas.{2}
Wow! You look just like the guy{3}who showed up in the fancy boat.{1}He slept for a long time... He{3}must've had a really long trip.{2}
You guys aren't the warriors{3}who came in that boat, are you?{30}
Hmm... A while ago, some{3}others came in a boat much{3}like yours...{1}I'm sure back on the mainland{3}that those boats are all very{3}popular, aren't they?{2}
It's not nice to tease an old{3}lady! If that's not your boat,{3}then how did you get here?{2}
I'm sure that boat is{3}quite comfortable...{1}But no matter how nice your{3}boat is, you can't beat sleeping{3}in a nice, dry bed on land.{2}
Those guys on the other{3}boat must have been pretty{3}well off...{2}
This little island must seem{3}quite boring to you{3}sophisticated mainlander types.{1}But we have our share of{3}hardships and trials.{2}
I'm sick of living on this{3}boring island paradise!{1}Ah! Does thinking that{3}make me a bad person?{2}
I'd love to go to the mainland.{3}I want to go somewhere{3}without any ocean!{2}
Whenever visitors come{3}out, the islanders start to{3}complain about their lives.{1}But they don't realize that{3}they live better here than{3}they ever could in Osenia.{2}
Maybe they'll take me with{3}them if I ask for a job! I can{3}swab a mean deck!{2}
I wonder what it's like,{3}standing in the middle of a{3}vast ocean of grass or sand.{2}
{16} checked the tablet.{3}It looks like there are strange{3}characters carved on it.{1}Wielder of Water's strength...{3}Lay your hands upon this stone.{1}If th'art worthy, the power{3}to drain away the standing{3}water shall be yours.{2}
Water's strength, huh? That sounds{3}like my sort of thing, doesn't it?{2}
{17}{8} tried to touch{3}the stone slate.{2}
What went wrong? What are{3}we going to do, {17}{5}?{2}
Maybe our power{3}is being tested.{2}
{16} checked the column.{1}
It's a column with a spot where{3}you can place something.{2}
You placed the {20}{1}.{2}
We've had a lot of trouble{3}here in Izumo lately.{1}I don't want to scare you,{3}but...you should leave, and fast.{3}Right now. Seriously. Run.{2}
My name's Okuni. I'm a great{3}dancer... Except I don't feel{3}much like dancing these days.{2}
Lady Uzume doesn't want{3}to sacrifice Kushinada.{1}But that's the only way{3}to appease the serpent...{2}
Susa's going to try to kill the{3}serpent and save his beloved{3}Kushinada. He's so fearless!{2}
As a child, Susa was as wild as{3}could be and brought his elder{3}sibling, Lady Uzume, much strife.{1}Kushinada is the one who tamed{3}his wild ways. Of course, no one{3}wants to see her sacrificed.{2}
Choosing the next sacrifice{3}by lottery seems such a{3}harsh method.{1}I am far too old to understand{3}the ideas of these modern times.{3}They seem far too extreme.{2}
The daughters of the family in{3}that home requested that we use{3}a lottery to choose the victims.{2}
A brave warrior will appear to{3}defeat the serpent by the next{3}full moon...{1}It's just a legend, though. No one{3}believes that. No one.{2}
See this ring of giant stones?{3}They've been here for ages.{3}No one knows who put them here.{1}See how they make{3}this beautiful circle?{3}Except for that one, right?{30}
Susa moved it... He didn't even{3}use his hands. He surely holds{3}the secrets to a great power.{2}
You're...not terribly{3}observant, are you?{2}
The misaligned stone! It's{3}back in its original position!{3}How did this happen!?{2}
Hmmm... Either Susa or Kushinada{3}must have moved it when{3}I wasn't looking.{2}
Can you imagine what it must{3}be like to have the power to move{3}stones without touching them?{1}That anyone should possess{3}that power is truly amazing.{2}
The Great Serpent of Mikage{3}has awakened... What does it all{3}mean?{1}That dragon is the guardian of{3}the island, so why is it treating{3}us so cruelly?{2}
I'm not going to be sacrificed,{3}but that doesn't mean I'm happy.{1}My dear friend Kushinada{3}doesn't deserve this, either...{2}
I'm sure that kindhearted{3}Lady Uzume doesn't want{3}to sacrifice anyone.{2}
What if losing Kushinada makes{3}Susa return to his wild ways?{3}I hope he fights the serpent...{1}If he loses, at least he won't{3}have to bear living without{3}Kushinada.{2}
Lady Uzume loves her brother{3}dearly... I'm sure she'd take{3}Kushinada's place if she could.{2}
Sacrifices as great as this{3}should not be determined by{3}chance alone...{2}
Kushinada's always had bad{3}luck at games of chance. I'll bet{3}those girls were counting on it.{2}
Why won't anybody listen{3}to Lady Uzume?{1}They've always trusted her,{3}at least up until now...{2}
Why does Lady Uzume have{3}me guarding these ruins?{3}What a waste of time...{2}
Okuni, Kushinada, and Lady Uzume{3}all drew in the lottery to choose{3}the next sacrifice with us...{1}I can't believe we drew{3}Kushinada. Is that chance? Fate?{3}I guess you never know...{2}
If Lady Uzume's name had been{3}drawn in the lottery, would she{3}have been the next sacrifice?{2}
I'm so relieved that I'm not{3}this year's sacrifice, but what{3}happens next year?{2}
Susa's been so sad all the{3}time, ever since Kushinada{3}was named the next sacrifice.{1}I never liked the old, wild Susa,{3}but he's so different now. Maybe{3}I can be his new girlfriend.{2}
Lady Uzume's been able to focus{3}on governing Izumo lately. I think{3}it's because Susa's calmed down.{2}
I only suggested this lottery{3}idea because I didn't want to{3}be sacrificed.{1}It looks like Kushinada really{3}does have bad luck, like{3}everyone says...{2}
What I want to know is, what{3}caused our legendary guardian{3}to awaken?{2}
A while back, a volcano erupted{3}on the mainland. We saw brilliant{3}flashes of light to the west.{1}The great dragon awoke shortly{3}afterward. It caused a terrible{3}panic through the island.{2}
That Dragonsbane seems to{3}have put the serpent under...{3}but for how long?{2}
I can't find my dagger...{3}I had it earlier... Where did it{176}{3}I wonder if Susa...{2}
I am old, and I've had enough of{3}this world. Why wouldn't I make{3}a good sacrifice for the dragon?{2}
The serpent can't stand sunlight,{3}so it only shows up in the village{3}at night. Just as the legend says.{2}
The serpent is only supposed{3}to awaken if the island is in{3}grave danger.{1}I wonder what calamity{3}is going to befall us...{2}
I wonder if all the recent{3}disasters aroused the dragon{3}from his slumber on the mountain.{2}
The serpent will drink as much{3}Dragonsbane as it can find,{3}right down to the last drop.{1}Nobody knows why they like{3}it so much, considering how{3}much it weakens them...{1}It must be like catnip to them.{2}
According to legend, that's the{3}only thing that can put the{3}serpent back to sleep.{1}As for the dagger...{3}I'll bet Susa's planning on{3}using it to save Kushinada.{2}
Our guardian serpent is really{3}just a dragon. Why do dragons{3}always want maiden sacrifices?{2}
There's no way to get sunlight{3}into the serpent's cave on{3}Mt. Mikage. Just no way...{2}
Yeah, Susa came through{3}here on his way to save{3}Kushinada.{1}The jerk knocked me flat{3}and just kept on going...{3}He was totally wild...{2}
Even if Susa tried to rescue{3}Kushinada, she wouldn't just{3}run away with him.{1}I think she still believes that{3}a hero will appear and defeat{3}the serpent. That must be it.{2}
You know, I can't stand Susa,{3}but I understand how he feels.{3}Kushinada's a really sweet girl.{2}
Lady Uzume says that a hero{3}would appear, but I don't know...{3}There's no hero coming...{1}If Susa came running past{3}me with Kushinada, I wouldn't{3}stop them.{2}
*Sniff*{2}
Susa, don't come{3}for me...{2}
If I see you, I'll surely lose{3}the courage to sacrifice{3}myself for Izumo.{2}
If I run, Lady Uzume and all{3}of Izumo will suffer greatly...{3}Please... Don't come for me.{2}
Lady Uzume has foretold{3}the coming of a hero,{3}and I believe her...{2}
And so I shall remain here,{3}until the coming of the next{3}full moon...{5}and the hero.{2}
Susa, please...{3}Don't try to save me.{2}
Susa's not here. I believe{3}he went to Mt. Mikage.{2}
He believes he can save{3}Kushinada, and so he has{3}gone to fight the serpent.{2}
He truly believes he can{3}defeat the Great Serpent{3}of Mikage.{2}
It's all for naught, though, as{3}a hero will certainly appear and{3}destroy the great serpent.{2}
If the serpent defeats Susa,{3}I'll...be alone.{2}
There's no point dancing{3}if Okuni's not here...{2}
The serpent attacked the{3}town one night during a{3}festival.{1}It didn't leave until it had{3}eaten all of the food we'd{3}prepared for our feast...{2}
The serpent ate all our food{3}and vanished into the darkness.{3}It ruined the festival.{2}
The serpent lives on Mt. Mikage.{3}In our tongue, its original name{3}meant "the undying mountain."{1}As long as the serpent{3}lives on its peak, I doubt the{3}serpent will ever die, either.{2}
I pray that our guardian's{3}anger is not aroused and{3}that Susa will be protected...{2}
Okuni's such a great dancer.{3}It's just so much more fun when{3}she's here to dance with us.{2}
The serpent would eat up{3}anything we put in front of{3}it! Its hunger knows no bounds.{2}
Before the serpent ate all{3}our food, it was a terror{3}to behold...{1}But afterwards?{3}He wasn't so bad.{1}No doubt about it, that{3}serpent sure knows good{3}food when he eats it.{2}
Legend has it that Mt. Mikage{3}is enshrouded by a mysterious{3}power.{1}I wonder if that's the source{3}of the serpent's eternal life.{2}
Izumo's leaders have always{3}possessed certain special{3}powers. Always.{1}And let me tell you, the{3}combined power of Susa and{3}Lady Uzume is stunning to see.{2}
One day, Kushinada put on{3}a display of power so great{3}that it almost rivaled Susa's!{1}It's such a shame...{3}I really wanted to see how{3}strong she might have become.{2}
The power that Lady Uzume{3}and Susa possess comes{3}from their ancestors.{1}It cannot be learned, and it{3}cannot be imitated.{2}
It was the day those bright rocks{3}fell from the sky... That's when{3}Kushinada gained her powers.{2}
Of course, I knew the legend of{3}the great serpent... Everyone{3}does! But I didn't believe it!{1}Sacrificing a young girl to the{3}serpent year after year?{3}It's too cruel to be true!{2}
If I were younger, I might{3}have been the sacrifice...{3}Ahh... It's so horrible!{2}
Things like this are really{3}going to hurt the inn... We get{3}few enough travelers as it is!{2}
What does that serpent plan{3}on doing with those young{3}women?{1}Surely, it doesn't intend{3}to marry all of them!{2}
Why would our guardian{3}spirit demand a sacrifice?{3}It's inexcusable!{1}A true guardian would never{3}require such a cruel tribute.{2}
*Sniff* How could we{3}sacrifice our beloved{3}Kushinada? It's not fair!{2}
When I get older, I might{3}have to be a sacrifice, too...{3}...What's a sacrifice?{2}
If only I possessed the power{3}to prevent this from happening.{3}Please grant me strength...{2}
I don't want the serpent of{3}Mt. Mikage to eat Kushinada.{3}Oh, won't somebody help her?{2}
Nobody wants to be a sacrifice,{3}so a sacrifice must be something{3}pretty scary.{2}
{16} checked the altar.{1}
There wasn't anything special.{2}
It looks like something{3}can be placed here.{2}
{16} placed a doll{3}on the altar.{2}
However, nothing happened.{2}
Who are you?{3}How did you get here?{2}
Only Uzume, Kushinada, and I{3}possess the ability to come here.{2}
Never mind. I don't have time{3}to talk. I have my hands full{3}getting the serpent to drink this.{2}
Once it's groggy,{3}that's when I'll strike...{2}
If you understand, then get{3}out of my way.{3}Stand over there.{2}
How many casks does it take{3}to weaken this stupid serpent?{2}
Move out of the way there.{2}
The cups are overflowing{3}with a river of Dragonsbane.{2}
You! You cannot fight the{3}serpent! Not while it's still in{3}full possession of its senses!{2}
At last... The serpent has{3}finally had its fill. This is{3}the chance I'd hoped for.{2}
I will defeat you before the{3}next full moon and rescue{3}Kushinada myself!{2}
All right, you so-called guardian!{3}Let's see what you've got!{2}
That's weird... It didn't{3}even react...{2}
Feeding the serpent Dragonsbane{3}isn't weakening it enough for{3}me to beat it!{2}
The serpent is still too strong.{1}If only there were a way to{3}weaken it further...{2}
The cups are overflowing{3}with a river of Dragonsbane.{2}
Who do they think they are?{3}I'm the only one who{3}can save Kushinada.{2}
Like I said, the serpent{3}can't be defeated by just{3}weakening it with Dragonsbane.{2}
It looks like the dragon is{3}in bad shape, but it doesn't{3}seem like it's close to dying...{2}
Even though the serpent's{3}been defeated, I can't rest!{2}
Be still, serpent, and I{3}will grant you peace.{2}
And with this, Kushinada's{3}life has been spared.{2}
You have my sincerest thanks.{2}
Where are you going?{2}
To Kushinada, of course.{2}
The serpent, with its eyes closed,{3}looks almost alive.{2}
I'm not dying...{3}I'm just so tired... I'm going{3}to lie down for a bit.{2}
If you're going to Izumo,{3}tell my sister that I'm{3}still alive.{2}
You're going to tell Kushinada{3}that you defeated the serpent,{3}aren't you?{30}
Ha ha ha! Of course! That's{3}exactly what happened!{2}
Please, you were the ones to{3}defeat it, so you should be{3}honest and accept credit.{2}
I really got worked over,{3}but as long as Kushinada's{3}safe, it was worth it.{2}
Kushinada's safe...{3}She's safe!{3}Nothing else matters.{2}
Those screams from{3}Mt. Mikage... They must{3}have come from the serpent.{1}That means Susa must{3}have saved Kushinada!{2}
We're planning a festival{3}to celebrate the end of the{3}serpent's reign of terror!{1}Lady Uzume is paying{3}for the whole thing, so{3}bring your dancin' feet!{2}
Susa has changed so much{3}from the wild youth we once{3}feared. He's saved our village.{2}
Kushinada has been spared?{3}I'm thrilled beyond words! She{3}did not deserve such a fate...{2}
I've heard people saying that{3}Susa had the help of other{3}heroes... Are you they?{2}
Susa has grown so much{3}to fight for his beloved{3}Kushinada so gallantly.{2}
Susa has put the serpent{3}back to rest, but not everyone{3}seems happy...{2}
Lady Uzume predicted that{3}a great hero would appear{3}to save Kushinada.{1}Nobody thought that hero{3}would be Susa!{2}
See this ring of giant stones?{3}They've been here for ages.{3}No one knows who put them here.{1}See how they make{3}this beautiful circle?{3}Except for that one, right?{30}
Susa moved it... He didn't even{3}use his hands. He surely holds{3}the secrets to a great power.{2}
You're...not terribly{3}observant, are you?{2}
The misaligned stone! It's{3}back in its original position!{3}How did this happen!?{2}
Hmmm... Either Susa or Kushinada{3}must have moved it when{3}I wasn't looking.{2}
But it's a festival!{3}Why do I have to keep{3}guarding the stone circle?{2}
I had always thought Susa was{3}nothing but a troublemaker, but{3}he's proven himself a hero now!{2}
This celebration will rival the{3}one that woke the serpent in{3}the first place!{2}
It's odd to think that so{3}many in the village once{3}despised Susa...{2}
Kushinada is such a sweet{3}girl. She should never have{3}been chosen in the lottery.{2}
What would make anyone{3}want to race up Mt. Mikage{3}and into the serpent's lair?{2}
All the girls must be so relieved{3}now that that awful lottery{3}has been ended forever.{2}
Everyone's been wondering{3}why the serpent wanted{3}a sacrifice... Was he lonely?{2}
So...Susa really was as much{3}of a hero as Lady Uzume{3}claimed... How disappointing.{2}
Susa did a momentous thing,{3}battling the serpent. So why do{3}I not want to congratulate him?{2}
I wonder if there's someone out{3}there who would sacrifice his{3}life for me. Will I ever find him?{2}
Dancing like this{3}is pure bliss.{2}
Everyone says that Susa is{3}the one to thank for returning{3}peace to our small village.{2}
We may never know what{3}was responsible for waking{3}the serpent from its slumber...{2}
Our island is safe at last!{3}It's time for us to celebrate{3}and enjoy ourselves again!{2}
The serpent taught us one{3}thing: Celebrate while you{3}can, but keep your eyes open!{2}
Lady Uzume and the others{3}aren't really blood relatives.{3}Does that surprise you?{30}
Well, they do possess a power no{3}one else has... Maybe that means{3}they are siblings after all.{2}
I'm just glad that Lady{3}Uzume used her powers{3}for the good of us all.{2}
All anyone talks about is how Susa{3}risked his life to save Kushinada.{3}I'm so jealous...{2}
A dragon, a hero, a damsel{3}in distress... That's got all the{3}makings for a fairy tale...{2}
Susa said the serpent wasn't{3}all that tough... He makes quite{3}a dashing hero!{2}
We need to figure out what woke{3}the serpent...{3}After the festival, maybe...{2}
Dancing is good for the soul!{1}Oooog... But too much{3}dancing...makes...me...{3}dizzy.{2}
That Susa used my dagger to{3}defeat the serpent.{1}He would never have won{3}if not for my dagger! And{3}he gets all the credit!{2}
As long as we have Lady{3}Uzume, Kushinada, and Susa{3}here, Izumo will be safe.{2}
If you're looking for Kushinada,{3}Lady Uzume escorted her to{3}the mansion.{1}Now that Susa has defeated{3}the serpent, Kushinada is no{3}longer being held as a sacrifice.{2}
Did you hear how Susa{3}defeated the serpent and{3}rescued Kushinada?{1}How come she doesn't{3}seem any happier now{3}that she's free?{2}
Lady Uzume and Kushinada{3}are as close as sisters.{3}It must be nice...{2}
Kushinada must be upset that{3}Susa defied his sister and{3}risked his life for her.{1}She worries about him{3}so much.{2}
Warriors appeared from within{3}Mt. Mikage?{2}
Yes... After the serpent's roar,{3}these warriors appeared.{2}
So, it wasn't Susa who defeated{3}the serpent, but those heroes...{2}
It might have been...{2}
Lady Kushinada, please{3}forgive me...{2}
I don't care who defeated{3}the serpent... I'm more worried{3}about what happened to Susa.{2}
So, Susa never came down{3}from Mt. Mikage?{2}
He returned to the village after{3}the heroes appeared, and he{3}knew the serpent was defeated.{2}
Oh, Susa...{2}
Who are you?{2}
This is my home, and I am{3}having a private conversation.{3}Leave at once!{2}
What is it?{2}
There can be no doubt...{3}These are the heroes who{3}appeared on Mt. Mikage.{2}
Are you the ones who{3}defeated the serpent?{2}
So it was you...{2}
My apologies...{3}You are welcome here.{2}
Who are you?{2}
I'm Kraden, and this{3}is {17}{5}.{2}
Behind him is {17}{8}.{2}
Pleased to meet you.{2}
I'm {17}{6}, and{3}this is {17}{7}.{2}
We're on a quest. Our travels{3}across the Great Eastern{3}Sea brought us here.{2}
You were seen coming down{3}from Mt. Mikage. What brought{3}you to such a dangerous place?{2}
To complete our quest, we{3}need many types of Psynergy.{2}
Psynergy?{2}
What is Psynergy?{2}
Psynergy is many things... The{3}power to move things with{3}one's mind, to heal, to create.{2}
All with one's mind?{2}
Tell me, is it something{3}like...this?{2}
Is that the power you're{3}talking about?{2}
That power?{3}Lady Uzume?{2}
It's not mine alone.{3}Kushinada and Susa{3}possess it as well.{2}
This is the power we possess.{3}I assume you have something{3}like it yourselves?{30}
I thought so. Only those who{3}can wield the power can see{3}it. And you did see it, didn't you?{2}
{17}{5}, there's no need{3}to hide our abilities from them,{3}is there?{2}
So, you call what we do{3}"Psynergy," and you can{3}do it, too?{2}
If you already have Psynergy,{3}why do you need more of{3}this power?{2}
Their powers are different{3}from our own. There seem to{3}be many forms of Psynergy.{2}
Susa!{2}
Susa...{2}
So, you lived after all, Susa...{2}
Yes, I've survived, and I've{3}made it home to you both.{2}
Thanks to them, actually...{2}
{17}{5}, our gratitude to{3}you and your friends grows{3}deeper each passing moment.{2}
Susa, you spoke of different{3}types of power. Tell me, what{3}did you mean?{2}
I can only describe what{3}I saw, my sister. Ask{3}{17}{5} here about it.{2}
Ah, yes. Psynergy... I have{3}dedicated most of my life{3}to its study...{2}
The power of Psynergy comes{3}from the four basic forces of{3}earth, fire, water, and wind.{1}These energies, the foundations{3}of Alchemy, are called{3}"Elementals."{2}
You don't know Alchemy?{3}The four elements?{1}Why, they're the very{3}building blocks of all{3}matter on Weyard.{2}
All existing matter comes from{3}Alchemy and this Psynergy?{2}
Yes, that's right. Everything{3}you see around you is some{3}combination of these elements.{2}
Does this mean that there{3}are as many types of Psynergy{3}as there are types of elements?{2}
That's right, Kushinada.{3}You're a smart lass.{2}
Mt. Mikage was a place of{3}great earth powers. I'd imagine{3}your powers are earth based.{2}
That's right, but how did{3}you know this?{2}
Kraden... Mt. Mikage is{3}Gaia Rock, isn't it?{2}
...Gaia Rock? Mt. Mikage is{3}the sacred mount of our people!{2}
Yes, but there are many mountains{3}like your Mt. Mikage all across{3}the Eastern Sea.{1}Mt. Mikage is a source of earth{3}power, and therefore, it must{3}be Gaia Rock.{2}
You have seen other mountains{3}like our Mt. Mikage?{2}
Yes! In fact, it seems that{3}each of these rocks contains{3}a different elemental power.{2}
And now, you are questing to{3}gather the power of these{3}elements, yes?{2}
And you only defeated the{3}Great Serpent of Mikage to{3}accomplish this goal?{30}
Regardless of your motives,{3}you have saved us all.{2}
You took pity on Kushinada?{3}You are very kind to help{3}Susa, {17}{5}.{2}
You're...not implying that we{3}defeated the serpent, are you?{2}
It's true that we did fight{3}the creature...{2}
But without Susa's power,{3}the battle might not have{3}ended so happily.{2}
What... What are you{176}{2}
Susa had given the beast a{3}lot of Dragonsbane in order{3}to weaken it.{2}
We could never have beaten{3}the beast if it had not been in{3}a...weakened state.{2}
We were victorious only{3}because Susa risked everything{3}to weaken the dragon.{2}
Susa, perhaps, after all, you are...{2}
No, I didn't...{2}
Don't forget, Susa dealt the{3}finishing blow, didn't he?{30}
Finishing blow? All I{3}did was stab it with{3}the Cloud Brand.{2}
That's right. Piercing it{3}with the Cloud Brand was{3}hardly a finishing blow.{2}
I disagree...{2}
You weakened the serpent.{3}You dealt the final blow.{3}I'd say you were essential.{2}
So, Lady Uzume, wouldn't you{3}say that Susa deserves{3}the reward for this feat?{2}
Even {17}{5} agrees,{3}don't you, {17}{5}?{30}
I do, too.{2}
We weren't fighting in hopes{3}of getting a reward, were we?{2}
We'll be satisfied just learning{3}your Psynergy.{2}
Are you asking for a reward?{3}That's just plain greedy!{2}
We couldn't possibly take{3}any sort of reward.{2}
Learning new Psynergy{3}will be reward enough.{2}
As you can see.{2}
Now, it's about time for us{3}to leave Izumo Village.{2}
Yes, indeed! We're on{3}our way to Lemuria.{2}
You're leaving so soon?{2}
We are in a great hurry.{2}
Then you must return to{3}Izumo someday.{2}
I'm sure we'll be back{3}once our mission{3}is completed.{2}
Excellent! I shall accept{3}that as your oath!{2}
...Oath?{2}
Oh, by promising to return, we'll{3}be ensuring that our quest will{3}end successfully...{2}
I understand... We must{3}vow to return, everyone.{2}
We'll be waiting.{2}
If you have time, won't{3}you enjoy a little of our{3}celebratory festival?{2}
Someday, Susa and I will have{3}a son, and we will name him{3}Takeru.{1}When he goes to sleep at night,{3}I will tell him the story of your{3}great deeds and your quest.{2}
I'm sure you know the villagers{3}believe I beat the serpent.{3}Don't let me take all the glory!{2}
If {17}{5}'s descendants{3}are ever in trouble, our{3}Takeru will rush to their aid.{2}
I'm no hero, but that shouldn't{3}stop anyone from treating me{3}like one.{2}
And what were you planning{3}to do, once you'd read my{3}mind, hm?{2}
{17}{5}, you read my{3}mind earlier, too, didn't you?{2}
You can't read my mind,{3}but if there is something you{3}want to know, I shall tell you.{2}
Trying again, {17}{5}?{3}What a pest.{1}You can see my mind, but{3}you are incapable of{3}peering into my heart.{2}
{17}{5}, wait!{2}
It troubled me to let you{3}leave like this...{2}
I owe you much for your help,{3}but I didn't have any way to{3}thank you...{2}
And then I thought of something.{2}
You're a warrior, and{3}warriors need weapons.{3}Wouldn't you agree?{30}
Are you sure about that?{3}I was only hoping to show{3}you my appreciation.{2}
Would you be willing{3}to accept a token{3}of my gratitude?{30}
This token isn't something{3}I possess. It's a legend, one{3}that might be of use to you.{2}
Long ago, the Great Serpent of{3}Mikage would sleep with its body{3}crossing the river...{2}
Where its tail fell, the{3}Cloud Brand lay hidden.{3}That's the legend, anyway.{2}
The serpent was once the{3}sword's protector, but it lost{3}the sword many ages past.{2}
Anyway, maybe you want{3}to go check out the dragon{3}again...{1}I left something there{3}for you...just as a way{3}of saying thank you.{2}
Well, I've said what I came to{3}say. I'm going back to Kushinada.{2}
I hope you are successful{3}in your quest.{2}
The legend says that the Cloud{3}Brand is a powerful weapon{3}for fighting dragons.{1}I trust you'll test the legend,{3}should the time come.{2}
Times of peace are so dull.{3}It makes me want to do something{3}outrageous to shake things up.{2}
They've been saying that you{3}went into Mt. Mikage, too...{3}Is that true?{30}
There's a legend about a doll{3}of mysterious power hidden{3}somewhere in the mountain.{1}I'm sure Lady Uzume would{3}by very pleased if you{3}were to find it for her.{2}
Oh... There's an old legend about{3}a dancing doll that has strange{3}powers hidden up there.{1}Lady Uzume really wants that{3}doll. Maybe Susa will find it{3}and bring it back for her...{2}
Supposedly, the doll has the{3}power to move the statues that{3}block light inside the mountain.{2}
Lady Uzume has grown quite{3}fond of this odd creature she{3}found... She's taken it as a pet.{2}
Lady Uzume's new pet affects{3}her powers in weird ways. It{3}doesn't do anything to us...{2}
Why does Lady Uzume want{3}that dancing doll so badly?{2}
I wonder what sort of dance{3}the doll does.{1}I'd love to see what it{3}looked like someday.{2}
I heard that Lady Uzume's pet{3}sometimesi disappears into{3}thin air...{1}Sound a little bit like that{3}cat I had when I was little.{2}
I don't know what it means{3}that Lady Uzume's pet{3}increases her power...{1}But these kids have seen a{3}lot of things I've never seen.{3}Maybe they understand...{2}
Ah... Could it be?{3}Is this the dancing doll{3}of Mt. Mikage?{30}
You found this at the peak{3}of Mt. Mikage?{2}
Don't lie to me. The style,{3}the craftsmanship... You must{3}have found this on Mt. Mikage.{2}
Again, you have done more{3}for me than I can properly{3}reward you for doing...{2}
I think I may have something{3}that might please you.{2}
This is my pet. It's very{3}dear to me.{2}
I am unsure how it works,{3}but this fellow seems{3}to magnify our power...{2}
Though it saddens me to part{3}with it, I would have you take{3}him, as he might help you...{2}
{17}{5} and his friends have{3}agreed to care for you{3}from now on.{2}
Please, accept this gift.{2}
With this dancing doll, I can{3}explore Mt. Mikage on my own.{3}Take care, {17}{5}.{2}
I'm grateful for the dancing{3}doll, but I do wish you'd stop{3}trying to read my mind.{1}If there is something you wish{3}to know, simply open your mouth{3}and ask.{2}
You must see many wonderful{3}things traveling across the{3}Eastern Sea.{1}How I'd love to travel like you{3}and see such wonders.{2}
My goods are among the{3}best on the island.{1}I'm sure there are things{3}the people on the mainland{3}would love to have.{2}
I'd love to travel the Great{3}Eastern Sea and get things{3}I can't find here on the island.{2}
This may be a small island, but{3}our craftsmanship is as good{3}as anything on the mainland.{1}It may seem impossible now,{3}but one day I'll be trading with{3}the shops in all the big cities.{2}
Briggs, from Champa, hasn't{3}been by selling much fish lately,{3}so our menu's suffered.{2}
As Lady Uzume foretold, the{3}serpent was defeated without{3}returning to our village.{2}
If Briggs's ship doesn't come{3}soon, we won't be able to{3}get any seafood.{1}Until then, all we'll have to{3}eat is freshwater fish.{2}
I understand now!{3}I had no idea why we were{3}preparing all those barrels.{1}If not for those barrels, the{3}serpent just might have{3}destroyed all of Izumo Village.{2}
Now that peace has been{3}restored, our island is{3}flourishing once more.{1}And I am most pleased{3}that we had no need of{3}any sacrifices!{2}
Now that the serpent's been{3}defeated, we don't have to{3}sacrifice anyone!{2}
If you're a sacrifice, that{3}means you have to marry{3}the dragon, right?{1}I'd hate to think what it{3}must be like, cooking for{3}a creature that big.{2}
I thank the powers that be{3}that I was not chosen as{3}a sacrifice.{2}
Maybe now, Kushinada{3}can come out and play.{3}What should we do, though?{2}
That dragon wanted a new{3}wife each and every year!{3}He must really like girls.{2}
{17}{5} searched the slate.{3}There is an inscription.{1}Wielder of Earth's might,{3}Lay your hands upon this stone.{1}I shall grant thee the power{3}to melt into the earth, the{3}power of Sand!{2}
Wielder of Earth's might...{3}That'd be you, {16}.{3}Touch it. Go on, don't worry!{2}
{16} touched the rock.{2}
{16} received{3}the power of Sand.{2}
I'm...sensing something...{2}
I can't feel anything...{2}
I'm done for... That dragon{3}has finished me off...{2}
Oh, I'm so hungry...{3}And there won't be anything{3}to eat until Briggs returns.{2}
When is Briggs going to return{3}with food for the village?{3}We can't wait much longer.{2}
How did you find your way{3}here, to the edge of Angara?{3}Champa is hidden by mountains.{1}No one ever climbs over to{3}see us, except for the monks{3}of the Fuchin Temple.{2}
Champa is impoverished, but{3}soon, we will prosper again.{1}All our hopes rest on Briggs{3}returning with a ship filled{3}with treasures!{2}
You've the look of a traveler{3}about you... Have you been to{3}Ankohl Ruins?{30}
Only those who have mastered{3}the powers of the earth can{3}enter the ruins.{2}
My mistake... These old eyes{3}aren't what they used to be.{1}Anyway, the ruins are just a{3}little ways northeast of here.{3}You should go see them.{2}
The ruins at Ankohl are all{3}that remains of a great{3}sanctum our ancestors built.{1}They must have been quite{3}wealthy to build such a{3}massive building.{2}
Eoleo, Briggs's son, has a{3}really strange ability...{1}I'll bet if I keep practicing,{3}I'll be able to do it, too, so I'm{3}giving it my all.{2}
Once Briggs comes back,{3}I can play with Eoleo again...{3}I hope they come back soon.{2}
The cliff caves are a lot{3}quieter with Briggs gone... It's{3}a little lonely without him here.{2}
Our matriarch is the last{3}successor of the Ankohl.{1}She's a master of the forge.{3}It was the ancient gift of{3}the Ankohl... {1}There's nothing{3}broken that they couldn't fix.{2}
The Champa sailors aren't...well{3}liked outside of here, are we?{30}
Hey, that hurts... You could{3}at least lie to me, just to{3}be polite...{1}If you keep spreading rumors{3}like that, you'll have a rough{3}time around here.{2}
Really? That's nice to hear.{3}But if you do hear anything,{3}don't believe a word of it.{2}
Where could Briggs be{3}wasting his time now?{2}
Briggs promised to bring{3}enough food for the whole{3}village.{2}
Champa is all alone on the{3}eastern edge of Angara. That's{3}why we took to the sea.{1}We had to learn to fend for{3}ourselves... That's why we{3}are seafaring people today.{2}
I bet Briggs has already{3}dug up the treasure and is{3}on his way back home.{2}
I want someone to solve{3}the riddle of Ankohl Ruins{3}before I die... It's my one wish!{2}
They say the chamber at the{3}top of the ruins is decorated{3}in the purest gold.{1}Our ancestors must have{3}been wealthy to afford{3}such extravagent decor.{2}
If I could pick up things{3}without using my hands,{3}life would be so much easier.{2}
Eoleo's so much younger than{3}I am, but I can't stop thinking{3}about him... Is that...love?{2}
Why haven't Briggs and{3}his men returned yet?{1}Obaba said not to go looking{3}for them, but what if they're{3}in trouble?{2}
Obaba's locked herself in her{3}room until her grandson, Briggs,{3}returns from sea.{1}She's so worried... She hasn't{3}even been eating. I hope{3}she's all right.{2}
If Briggs would just bring the{3}treasure he found back to{3}Champa, we could all prosper.{1}Then we could put this pirate{3}business behind us for good.{2}
There's not much space in the{3}cliff caves. That's why we have{3}to live out here on the boats.{2}
Everyone in Champa is poor,{3}but the poorest of us all live{3}on rafts... I want to live on land.{2}
When my father heads out{3}to sea, he takes our home{3}with him and leaves us cold.{1}But when he comes home{3}with an empty net, that{3}leaves us cold AND hungry.{2}
My dad went out to fish, but there{3}were no fish to be caught, so he{3}had to come back empty-handed.{2}
These rafts are all we have!{3}There's no place left for us{3}on dry land!{2}
If Dad hadn't been opposed to{3}Briggs becoming a pirate, we'd{3}still be living on land...{2}
I hope Dad makes it back before{3}dark... I don't want to have to{3}sleep on shore with no shelter.{2}
Father worries so much{3}about the lack of fish...{1}He used to come back with fish{3}jumping out of his nets. Why{3}can't he catch fish anymore?{2}
The tidal wave was terrible...{3}It... It nearly swallowed me{3}whole!{2}
It looked to me like the wave{3}came from the Sea of Time.{3}What's in there? What caused it?{2}
Most of the sailors here live in{3}the cliff dwellings, but I don't{3}like those caves. They're dank!{1}And what's worse, the people{3}living in the harbor really{3}resent the cliff-dwellers.{2}
The fish are vanishing. I'm{3}sailing farther and farther{3}for fewer and fewer fish.{2}
Something must have blown up{3}in the Sea of Time. That would{3}explain the tidal wave.{2}
You have to be one of the{3}pirates to live in the cliffs...{3}I just can't do it...{2}
We've seen a lot of traveling{3}warriors in Champa of late.{1}We never used to... I wonder{3}if it's just a coincidence that{3}we've seen so many lately...{2}
A group of travelers came here{3}looking for a {17}{5}.{1}He seems to be a fairly{3}popular guy.{2}
More visitors means more{3}money for our village... Maybe{3}we'll even get tourists soon!{2}
Now that I think about it,{3}someone else was looking{3}for a {17}{5}, too.{1}I'll bet that guy is probably{3}still somewhere in town...{2}
The ocean has been a lot{3}warmer lately, and the fish{3}population is decreasing.{1}It's not natural for the{3}ocean to be so warm.{3}What's causing it?{2}
I've heard rumors of a terrible{3}tidal wave striking the lands{3}south of us.{1}I sure hope Briggs and his{3}men weren't engulfed by it...{2}
We Champa rely entirely on the{3}ocean for our survival. It's all{3}we've ever known...{1}I wish the Eastern Sea would{3}return to its bountiful days of{3}overflowing nets and smooth seas.{2}
All the sailors are saying{3}the tidal wave down south{3}was unbelievably huge.{1}If Briggs were caught up in{3}it, I don't think he could{3}have survived.{2}
Obaba's not seeing anyone{3}right now.{1}She's concerned about her{3}grandson, and she doesn't{3}want to be bothered.{2}
Has my grandson returned?{3}Has my Briggs come home?{30}
You lie! If Briggs had truly{3}returned, he would have come{3}to see me first!{2}
I asked not to be disturbed{3}until my grandson has returned{3}home! Now, let me be!{2}
That pit is Obaba's forge. She{3}uses it when she's working metal{3}into weapons and equipment.{2}
Before he left, Briggs ordered{3}me to keep watch in his absence.{1}If Obaba is so worried about{3}Briggs, she ought to send{3}someone out to look for him.{2}
All of our men went to sea with{3}Briggs{176}even my sweetheart!{3}I hope they return soon.{2}
I bet you're wondering why only{3}sailors and their families get to{3}live in the cliff dwellings.{1}Well, from up here on the cliffs,{3}families can look out to sea and{3}await the return of their sailors.{2}
The Champa sailors who don't{3}live in the cliffs are no better{3}than cowards.{1}The ones living in the caves will{3}protect Briggs and Obaba{3}without a second thought.{2}
My husband wants our children{3}to be sailors like him, but I{3}simply won't have it.{2}
Someday, I want to be a sailor,{3}like my father before me. My{3}mother hates the idea, though.{1}She'd rather have me study and{3}become a scholar or something.{2}
Mom's had it pretty rough. I hope{3}I meet a sailor with a future, so I{3}don't have to work so hard.{2}
I've never seen Obaba like{3}this before.{1}She must be really worried{3}about Briggs...{2}
I wonder how deep this forge{3}goes. It's supposed to reach{3}right into the mountain's heart.{1}Obaba must be a master of the{3}forge if she's the only one{3}who can call up its flames.{2}
Briggs may be our captain, but{3}at least he's not all full of{3}himself. I hate people like that.{2}
Briggs is the greatest{3}among all our sailors.{1}As long as he is leading our{3}men, they'll make it back to{3}Champa just fine.{2}
Standing here, staring across the{3}sea from these cliffs, makes me{3}feel like I'm helping our sailors.{2}
If you live up in the cliffs, that{3}means you've proven that you{3}can travel far across the seas.{1}If you call yourself a sailor{3}without ever going anywhere,{3}you're not worthy of the title.{2}
When I married a sailor, I knew{3}how cruel the sea could be.{1}I can't stop my husband from{3}sailing, but I don't want our{3}children to follow that path.{2}
Has Mom forgotten that{3}I am my father's son?{1}If she knew anything about{3}me, she'd never ask me to{3}give up the sailor's life.{2}
Eoleo is the only boy in town{3}who will amount to anything...{3}He will be mine!{2}
I have some lovely artifacts,{3}but it's only because I've been{3}to the Ankohl Ruins.{2}
If you go to the Ankohl Ruins,{3}you might find some nice{3}artifacts for yourself.{2}
Our products cost what they cost{3}for a reason: they're all rare and{3}valuable treasures from Ankohl.{1}If I risk my life to get something{3}nice, of course I'm going to ask{3}a higher price for it!{2}
The stuff in the ruins just sits{3}there waiting for someone to{3}come along and take it.{1}But if it's broken, I'm the only{3}guy in town who can fix it.{2}
Listen, if you came to Champa{3}looking for good seafood, you{3}came to the wrong place.{1}We haven't had a decent{3}catch in months. It's like{3}all the fish are just...gone.{2}
We used to do good trade{3}with an island east of us. They{3}bought all our surplus fish.{1}We don't have any surplus{3}anymore. We don't even have{3}enough for ourselves.{2}
It's a shame that we can't{3}offer any fish to our customers.{1}Ah, how I long for the days{3}when we had fish enough{3}for everyone.{2}
Watching our catches dwindle{3}with every day... It's a nightmare!{3}Where have all the fish gone?{2}
Briggs bears the weight{3}of hope for our struggling,{3}impoverished village.{1}He must return home soon,{3}before all the villagers lose hope{3}and fall into despair.{2}
I hope Briggs brings something{3}home for us... If not, it might{3}be the end of Champa...{2}
I see you've caught up with{3}me again, {17}{5}.{2}
Alex!{2}
Alex? Who is Alex?{2}
Alex is a Water Adept. We had{3}been traveling together, but he{3}left us when we landed on Indra.{2}
A Water Adept?{2}
Ah, and I see you've made{3}a new friend! You have been{3}busy, haven't you?{30}
And you've found yourself a{3}new Water Adept! Do you mean{3}to cast me away, like old trash?{2}
Please... It's quite obvious that{3}you decided to replace me with{3}a new Water Adept.{1}I expect you thought you'd{3}never see me again!{2}
What do you want with us now,{3}Alex? Or did you forget you were{3}the one who abandoned US?{2}
My dear {17}{6}...{2}
Have you come to despise me{3}so, after all we've been through?{30}
That's right, {17}{5}! Why should{3}we care about someone who{3}just left us behind like that!?{2}
Duh! You're the one who left{3}us. It's pretty clear who{3}despises whom here.{2}
My, aren't we a bitter bunch?{3}And I was just trying to help{3}you with your little task.{2}
We have no need of your help.{3}We can light the lighthouses{3}without you.{2}
Oh... Can you really?{2}
Karst!{2}
That's right, Karst! I'm{3}flattered that you remember!{2}
What is this, Alex?{3}What's going on?{2}
Ah, how can I explain this...{2}
What's going on is Alex is{3}demonstrating his remarkable{3}foresight once again!{2}
Oh, have you not had the{3}pleasure of an introduction?{2}
He stayed back at the ship{3}when I saw them in Madra.{2}
I am Agatio.{2}
Let's see... That guy's {17}{5},{3}and the girls are {17}{6} and {17}{7},{3}which makes him...Kraden.{2}
They look like an unreliable{3}bunch of ragamuffins.{2}
Yes, they are rather useless,{3}aren't they? That's why I finally{3}had to abandon them, of course.{2}
But now, I believe I may have{3}been...hasty in my judgment.{2}
You are {17}{8}?{2}
H-How do you know my name?{2}
How soon they forget!{3}We met you before, when you{3}were being...detained.{2}
Who could forget the amateur{3}Adept changing water to ice{3}in that strange little town?{2}
Ah! You saw that! That must{3}be how you knew {17}{8}{3}was a Water Adept.{2}
In fact, I was even thinking of{3}borrowing his ship at one point.{2}
You would steal someone's{3}boat? That's so typical, Alex!{2}
You wound me, {17}{6}...{3}I only meant to borrow it.{2}
Whatever you might have{3}meant, that doesn't make it right!{2}
And just when I was about{3}to seize the opportunity,{3}you had to come back.{2}
You mean from Kibombo...{2}
I was mere moments too late.{2}
Isn't that a shame.{2}
Still, because of that, I did{3}meet Karst and Agatio, so{3}perhaps it was my fate...{2}
Can't you just stop talking about{3}yourself for one second, Alex?{2}
Enough of your childish gibes!{3}Alex, I want to know what{3}makes these punks useful!{2}
Because they brought us the orb{3}that Akafubu had taken. That{3}shows some resourcefulness.{2}
How so?{2}
The Kibombo are quite warlike...{3}or were, at any rate. Recovering{3}the orb was most likely not easy.{2}
They were just typical villagers,{3}easily frightened with a small{3}display of Psynergy...{2}
No... They would have used less{3}abrupt methods than those you{3}favor...{2}
Oh? What methods would{3}those be?{2}
Alex said it clearly enough.{3}We wouldn't terrorize people{3}into doing what we wanted.{2}
Enough of this!{2}
Stop changing the subject!{3}When are you going to light{3}the remaining lighthouses?{2}
Yes! Our patience is beginning{3}to wear thin!{2}
If you waste much more of our{3}time, we'll take those Elemental{3}Stars and do it ourselves!{2}
If we had a Wind Adept like{3}{17}{7} and the Elemental{3}Stars, we wouldn't need you.{2}
Excuse me?{2}
I am, of course, opposed{3}to their line of thinking.{2}
My experience with Saturos{3}and Menardi suggests that,{3}while they were fierce warriors...{1}They are somewhat lacking{3}when it comes to solving the{3}mysteries of the lighthouses...{2}
You mean to say that they{3}failed to solve the riddles?{2}
Miserably...{2}
Are you suggesting they were{3}simple brutes, incapable of{3}logic and intelligence?{1}And are you saying the{3}same of us!?{2}
I'm afraid so...{2}
Alex... Whose side{3}are you on?{2}
I am on no one's side. My only{3}concern is to see the lighthouse{3}beacons lit once again.{2}
So you mean to leave the{3}task to {17}{5}?{2}
Then why have we come all this{3}way looking for {17}{5}?{2}
I merely wanted to confirm{3}that he and his companions{3}had not forgotten their quest.{2}
Is that truly all?{2}
I also wanted to introduce{3}{17}{5} to the two of you.{2}
Why would you want to do that?{2}
With Saturos and Menardi gone,{3}you probably felt very little{3}pressure to complete your task.{1}I cannot have that.{2}
What do you mean by that!?{2}
With Saturos and Menardi gone,{3}I felt another pair might...{3}How shall I put this...{1}Provide you with the proper{3}incentive to complete your task.{2}
Is that some kind of threat?{2}
Take it as you wish. I just{3}wanted to provide you with{3}the proper encouragement.{2}
So, what? You've used us to{3}your satisfaction, and now,{3}our role is done?{2}
You only wanted us around to{3}flex a little muscle and scare{3}them into action? Fine.{2}
I suppose we will let you{3}go today...{2}
But we will always be nearby...{3}pushing you to make your way{3}to Jupiter Lighthouse swiftly.{2}
I look forward to seeing you{3}soon, {17}{5}, somewhere{3}very near Jupiter Lighthouse.{2}
Kraden, am I right in recalling{3}that you pursue this quest on{3}the behalf of Tolbi's ruler, Babi?{2}
This is true. I'm studying{3}Alchemy because Lord Babi{3}has ordered it.{2}
What about it?{2}
Ah, what a pity. It would{3}seem all your studies...{3}have been for naught.{2}
What are you getting at, Alex?{2}
Only that it seems your Lord{3}Babi has at last succumbed{3}to the ravages of time.{2}
Lord Babi is dead?{2}
Oh, so you didn't know?{2}
Lord Babi? Dead? Could{3}that really be true?{2}
Alex! How would you know{3}such a thing?{2}
Do not mistake me! We had no{3}hand in Babi's passing.{2}
However, the people of Tolbi{3}may be under the impression that{3}our presence led to his death.{2}
Alex! Cut the melodrama{3}and get to the point for a{3}change!{2}
Simply put, I would recommend{3}against traveling to north{3}Gondowan for a while.{2}
I just thought it might be better{3}if you focused on your quest,{3}instead of exploration, for now...{2}
How kind of you.{2}
Take it as you will...{2}
Very well. May we meet again.{2}
So the only reason Alex came{3}here was to threaten us?{2}
And to bring us news of Babi's{3}death, despite the fact that we{3}asked for no such news!{2}
Perhaps he had his own reasons{3}for telling Kraden...{2}
What do you mean, {17}{8}?{2}
If Kraden undertook this quest{3}on behalf of Babi, then he no{3}longer has any need{176}{2}
Oh. Of course! I hadn't thought{3}of that. Your orders were to find{3}Lemuria, right, Kraden?{2}
That's right. But if Babi really{3}has died, you're free to go{3}where you will, Kraden.{2}
That's not true, {17}{7}.{2}
Certainly, my original reason{3}for researching Alchemy was{3}for Lord Babi...{2}
"Was for Lord Babi"? That's{3}the past tense! What are your{3}reasons now?{2}
This is no longer solely for{3}research... I do this because of{3}what I've learned on this quest.{2}
Your research?{2}
What you learned on this quest?{2}
I'm not following you at all!{30}
I don't understand a word of this.{30}
Of course you don't! {17}{5}{3}is the only one I've spoken{3}to about any of this...{2}
What!? You knew!?{30}
That's not fair! Tell us!{30}
Please, {17}{5}... Let's not{3}say too much about it just yet.{2}
{17}{5} is right. Now is{3}not the time to tell you{3}about it all...{2}
It's...far too complicated.{2}
Well, when WILL you tell us?{2}
I am sure we will tell you once{3}we get to Lemuria.{2}
Do you promise?{2}
I promise...{2}
{17}{8}? You don't{3}mind waiting?{2}
I cannot read minds, like{3}{17}{7}, but I have a guess{3}at what you're thinking...{2}
A guess? What do you mean?{2}
You are a great scholar,{3}Kraden, are you not?{2}
I believe your theory is correct.{3}And to prove it, I want to return{3}to Lemuria as soon as possible.{2}
Getting Trident (TEMP){2}
It's the middle of three tines.{2}
It reads: Search by the water's{3}edge where the letter had fallen.{2}
It reads: Two Steps north of the{3}middle grave where the{3}letter had fallen.{2}
Champa ahead!{2}
Hey! That block on the{3}mast has disappeared!{2}
Hey! Now, we can raise the mast{3}and use the sail again!{2}
Hey, mate, let's go tell the{3}mayor the good news!{2}
Yeah, let's do that!{2}
Baba babubu!! {2}
What is it, Eoleo? What{3}are you so excited about?{2}
Baba babubu!{2}
It's true! The block that was{3}pinning the mast down is gone!{2}
You were the ones who{3}did it, weren't you?{30}
I knew you would{3}do it someday.{2}
But, of course, I also know that{3}you didn't do it for our benefit.{2}
Still, Briggs will be pleased{3}when he hears about this.{2}
Well then, let's go tell him!{2}
I still just can't quite believe{3}that the stone block on top of{3}the mast has totally vanished.{2}
I'm telling you, Mayor, I saw{3}it with my own eyes! ...I mean,{3}I didn't see it! It's gone!{2}
If you don't believe us, you{3}can go see for yourself!{2}
Huh?{2}
What?{2}
Whoa, hey!!!{2}
It's gone! That huge block{3}is really gone!{2}
Excellent news, Mayor!{2}
Unfortunately, the mayor of{3}Madra will probably try to{3}take it from us now.{2}
But that can wait. Who was{3}able to move the block?{2}
{17}{5}!{2}
{17}{5}, did you do this?{2}
Surprised to see us, Mayor?{2}
Did you do this?{2}
We left Alhafra some time ago,{3}but we just returned and{3}destroyed the stone block.{2}
Exploring? What brought you{3}back to Alhafra right now?{2}
{17}{5} had a hunch that{3}we might be needed here.{2}
Mayor, not to interrupt, but{3}shouldn't we begin repairs{3}on your ship now?{2}
Yes, yes... You're right, of course.{2}
Gather the townspeople and{3}get them to work on the mast.{2}
Yes, sir! We're on our way!{2}
We shouldn't need too many{3}people to raise the mast!{2}
All right. I'm counting on you.{2}
Destroying that stone must{3}have been quite a challenge.{2}
Why don't you come back to{3}my manor to get some rest?{30}
We could use the rest,{3}{17}{5}. We should accept{3}the mayor's offer.{2}
You're too kind, Mayor. We'd{3}be happy to...{2}
Thank you again, Mayor.{3}You keep a fine house.{2}
Don't be silly. You've done{3}us a great deed.{2}
It was the least{3}I could do.{2}
Even if he gets the boat fixed,{3}I don't think he's going to hand{3}it over to Madra...{2}
I agree... He's being way too{3}nice for me not to be a little{3}suspicious of him...{2}
I'm sorry, did you girls{3}have something you'd{3}like to share with us?{2}
I see!{2}
Jiya, how are the repairs coming{3}along? Things seem to be moving{3}slowly down there.{2}
Milord, these things take time...{2}
Sir, there's a problem!{2}
Calm down, man! You're a{3}soldier! What are you so{3}flustered about!?{2}
Briggs destroyed the prison{3}and escaped with his pirates!{2}
What, were you asleep while{3}this was going on?{2}
Don't... Don't be silly!{2}
How could Briggs possibly{3}break out of our prison? It's{3}one of the strongest in Osenia!{2}
I don't know what happened,{3}but before I knew it, they'd{3}smashed a hole in the wall!{2}
Mayor! The mast has been{3}raised!{2}
Hey, what's up?{2}
Wait, you're supposed to{3}be guarding the prisoners...{3}What happened?{2}
It appears that Briggs{3}has escaped.{2}
That's no good...{2}
What are you standing around{3}for!? Search the area! Find{3}Briggs at once!{2}
It...might not be quite{3}that easy...{2}
He is a pirate, after all...{3}A famous one!{2}
Enough of that! Move it!{2}
Regardless, I'm going to go{3}inspect my boat...{2}
Oh, and {17}{5} and his crew{3}were there, too, weren't they?{2}
I treated you like an honored{3}guest in my home...{2}
Usually, one feels a certain{3}obligation to those who do them{3}such a kind service, am I right?{2}
So, don't just stand there!{3}Return the favor and find{3}me Briggs!{2}
Come on! Hurry up!{3}Let's go! Move it!{2}
Let's go see the boat.{2}
The mayor of Alhafra certainly{3}does know how to look out for{3}his own interest, doesn't he?{2}
That's one way of putting it!{2}
Well, so what do we do? Do{3}we go after Briggs?{30}
Don't feel like you have to{3}do them any favors!{2}
That's right! Why should we{3}help the mayor, after the way{3}he treated you!{2}
{17}{5} can decide for{3}himself what to do...{2}
At the very least, I want to{3}go see the sailing ship{3}now that it's fixed.{2}
Let's just go outside and{3}take a quick look.{2}
Everyone in town is talking{3}about how the boat's finally{3}been fixed! You should see it!{2}
The whole town is grateful to{3}you... Without your help, we{3}couldn't have fixed the mast!{2}
I'm just standing guard, in{3}case Briggs decides to{3}attack the mayor's manor.{2}
Our sailboat looks fabulous{3}with its mast repaired! You{3}really must go check it out!{2}
I wonder where Briggs and{3}his crew went... There's no sign{3}of them around here...{2}
I heard you made it so we{3}could fix our sailboat! Is there{3}anything you CAN'T do?{2}
Ever since we heard Briggs{3}broke out of jail, we've all{3}been a little nervous...{2}
I don't know why everyone's so{3}excited about fixing the ship. We{3}promised it to Madra, didn't we?{2}
Oh! It's you! Where have you{3}been? We haven't seen you{3}around Alhafra lately...{2}
With that ship, Alhafra's going{3}to become a big, important{3}trading town... We'll all be rich!{2}
Once that stone was taken{3}care of, it was really quite{3}easy to raise the mast again.{2}
If Briggs is smart, he's{3}probably long gone from{3}Alhafra, if you ask me.{2}
I've been waiting for this day{3}for years! I can't wait to set{3}sail across the Eastern Sea.{2}
The secret to harnessing the{3}wind's power is building a small{3}ship. Large ones can't do it.{2}
I'm sure it's just a coincidence,{3}but whenever you show up,{3}trouble happens.{2}
The mayor was actually singing{3}and skipping when he went to{3}the dock. He seemed so pleased.{2}
Weird... Have you ever had the{3}feeling that someone just{3}passed by? Maybe it's just me.{2}
Huge boats carry more, but{3}we need smaller ships to{3}catch the wind.{1}The mayor just doesn't{3}understand this...{2}
I don't know what the big{3}rush is. We can see the boat{3}whenever we want. It's ours!{2}
Now that the boat is fixed,{3}who gets to keep it? Us? Or{3}the Madrans?{2}
I'm supposed to be guarding{3}in case Briggs shows up. But{3}if he does, I'll probably just cry.{2}
Who cares if the boat is fixed?{3}It's not like we'll be allowed on{3}board. The mayor's too selfish.{2}
Why do I have to look for{3}Briggs? It's not my fault{3}he escaped...{2}
I hate to tell {17}{5}, but{3}even though our mayor seems{3}nice, he's really a selfish jerk.{2}
I'd bet that Briggs fled the{3}city at the first chance. I really{3}wonder if he'd still be here.{2}
Briggs paid a lot for a broken{3}boat, but now that it's fixed, it's{3}practically priceless!{2} 
{17}{5} must have found himself{3}a boat... Isn't that what brought{3}him to Alhafra in the first place?{2}
I'm certain the only person to{3}prosper from the boat will be{3}that oaf of a mayor.{2}
Now that all the debris{3}has been cleared away,{3}our harbor looks so nice.{2}
The mayor said I had to look{3}for pirates... Where am I{3}supposed to be looking?{2}
I'm probably too old for the{3}mayor to let me on the ship,{3}but I can still have my dreams.{2}
Smaller ships use their sails{3}to steer a lot, but it must be{3}harder when your ship's so big.{2}
It's been so busy around here...{3}Pirates, warriors, sailing ships,{3}natural disasters. What a week!{2}
The mayor only had one thing{3}on his mind on his way to the{3}dock... Money, and lots of it.{2}
What if the pirates were{3}nearby... Maybe that was{3}them behind the building...{2}
Without smaller ships, how{3}can we catch the fish we{3}need to eat?{2}
Oooog... Ow...{2}
Why do these things{3}always happen to me?{2}
Stupid Briggs...{2}
Briggs's pirates... They{3}attacked us and...{3}The ship... The ship...{2}
I just came down to see the{3}repaired mast, and they jumped{3}on me from out of nowhere.{2}
Briggs said the boat was{3}his... And, to be honest, they{3}had paid us for it, but...{2}
Briggs!!!{2}
Briggs, where are you{3}taking my boat?{2}
He's attempting to steal it!{3}Thief! Thief!{2}
Did you call me a thief?{2}
I paid for this boat, fair{3}and square. I'm no thief.{2}
You're the thieves! You tried{3}to take our boat away, after{3}we paid you so much for it!{2}
... ...{2}
You're the one who{3}stole OUR boat!{2}
Ahoy, Briggs!{2}
Uh-oh... It's {17}{5}!{2}
You're not afraid of{3}them, are you?{2}
Look how far away they are...{3}There's no way they can{3}catch us now!{2}
You're right... They're stuck on{3}the land, and we've got this boat!{2}
They can't catch us...{3}What would they do, swim?{2}
Hah! You're right! They can't{3}board us from way over there!{2}
Wasn't there something you{3}wanted to do the next time{3}you saw {17}{5}?{2}
Don't tell me you forgot...{3}It's all you ever talked about{3}when you were in jail!{2}
Oh yeah... I almost forgot.{2}
So now's your chance!{3}Do what you swore to do!{2}
Bleah!{2}
Is that the best you could{3}come up with?{2}
But, Chaucha, they're an{3}awfully tough bunch...{2}
See? It's that attitude right{3}there! That's why you'll{3}never amount to anything!{2}
You know what? You're right!{2}
Hey! {17}{5}!{3}You guys take care!{1}And keep Alhafra safe{3}from thieves and pirates!{3}And politicians, too!{2}
What!?!{2}
I doubt we'll ever meet{3}again, but if we do,{3}remember this!{2}
Neener neener neener!{3}Neener neener neener!{2}
Neener neener bleah!{2}
That may have been a bit much.{3}If you make him mad, he might{3}chase us right back to Champa.{2}
What!!! You let Briggs{3}get away!{2}
You and your friends talk a{3}good game, but when trouble{3}happens, where are you!?{2}
Well, isn't this a fine mess!{2}
My prize ship, stolen by a{3}bunch of filthy pirate scum!{2}
Get up!{2}
They're gone, and you let{3}them escape!{2}
You guys have royally botched{3}this one. This ruins everything!{2}
You all ought to be ashamed! All{3}of you were cowering, while I was{3}the only one to stand up to them!{2}
All of you!{2}
I'm going back to my manor!{2}
And you, {17}{5}. I am{3}extremely disappointed in you.{2}
There will be no reward for{3}you, {17}{5}!{2}
You let that Briggs steal MY{3}ship! You're lucky I don't lock{3}you up in his stead!{2}
Bah! I've had enough of this!{3}Don't just stand there with your{3}mouths gaping! Get out of here!{2}
We don't have a boat, so there's{3}no reason for anyone to be{3}here at the port. Return to town.{2}
What an awful person.{3}Do you suppose he's always{3}this self-centered?{30}
Yes, he's terribly irritating.{3}You're quite right, {17}{5}.{2}
You can stay calm after{3}listening to that windbag?{3}That's quite mature of you.{2}
I'll wager Briggs is returning{3}to Champa, personally.{2}
Well, it doesn't matter. I think{3}I've had enough of this town.{3}Shall we be leaving?{30}
Ah, yes, well... If you still have{3}business to attend to here.{2}
All right. But the sooner we leave,{3}the better. Lead on, {17}{5}!{2}
Great! Let's leave as soon{3}as possible, shall we?{2}
Alhafra lost its ship. Now, we're{3}nothing but a big, boring town{3}in the middle of Osenia.{2}
Even though we lost the big boat,{3}I'm not particularly upset.{1}We'll be just fine if everyone{3}can work together and build{3}a fleet of smaller boats.{2}
After we did all that work to{3}fix the mast, someone goes and{3}steals our boat.{1}We never should have fixed{3}it in the first place.{2}
It was great to see everyone{3}in town working to raise the{3}mast. Too bad the boat got stolen.{2}
When they find that their boat was{3}stolen, I'm sure Madra's not going{3}to be too happy.{2}
It's not like the boat could{3}even move when the mast{3}was still broken...{1}When you think of it that{3}way, it doesn't feel like we{3}really lost anything at all.{2}
The repairs are coming along{3}pretty slowly, aren't they?{1}Well, you wouldn't feel much{3}like working either if your last{3}major project was stolen!{2}
When is this house going to be{3}finished once and for all!? The{3}repairs are taking forever!{2}
It felt so great when the whole{3}town joined together to get{3}those boat repairs done.{2}
Back before Briggs destroyed{3}the bridge to the west, it was{3}a lot easier to trade with Madra.{2}
We fixed the mast so we{3}could use that boat.{1}Now, Briggs has taken the boat{3}and sailed off to Champa.{2}
If they caught a good breeze,{3}they're probably way off to the{3}north of us by now.{2}
If only we had that ship, Alhafra{3}could have been a powerful{3}trading town...and wealthy, too...{2}
I hope trade doesn't make{3}Alhafra get all big. I like how{3}quiet things are around here...{1}We should stay a small town,{3}with our small little boats.{2}
It was Madra's boat. It{3}should have been Madra's{3}problem...{2}
The mayor seemed so happy to{3}see us working on the boat...{3}That's kind of strange.{1}After all, we were only fixing{3}it so we could give it to{3}Madra, weren't we?{2}
The mayor of Madra seems like{3}a reasonable person. It's too{3}bad this had to happen.{2}
We're all pulling together to fix{3}this house. At least everyone{3}is helping with the work.{2}
If Mom would stop making all{3}these trifling little requests,{3}we'd be done a lot faster...{2}
I know it's time to forget about{3}that boat and get back to work...{3}But I just can't let it go.{2}
First, he steals a ship...then he{3}ruins a very important bridge...{3}Briggs is a real jerk.{2}
Why worry about Briggs? It's{3}not as though we've got a boat{3}to chase him with...{2}
If Briggs hadn't stolen that{3}boat, I'd be out on the open{3}sea right now, wind in my hair.{2}
There's no point in worrying{3}about losing something we{3}never had to begin with.{2}
I don't want to say this{3}out loud or anything, but...{1}Briggs paid for that boat{3}fair and square. He didn't{3}steal it at all.{2}
Briggs didn't commit any{3}crimes in Alhafra, did he?{2}
Briggs paid for the boat and{3}then left in it. Why is everyone{3}treating him like a crook?{2}
I don't believe for one second{3}that Briggs was a pirate,{3}raiding the towns of Indra.{2}
Fixing that old guy's house is{3}starting to drive us all crazy.{1}I, for one, will be ready for a{3}celebration once it's done.{2}
The repairs on our neighbors'{3}house are moving slowly.{1}The longer it takes, the longer{3}they live with us!{2}
My house is damaged more than{3}I thought. Looks like I'm still{3}stuck here with my neighbors.{2}
My husband and I don't get{3}out much, and it's nice to{3}meet the neighbors...{1}But we've been here for so{3}long, I don't think we'll be{3}going out for quite a while.{2}
Will they ever get out of my{3}house? It's starting to worry{3}me a bit...{2}
I don't have anything to say{3}to them, and I'm tired of being{3}the good hostess all the time!{2}
I don't mind not being at{3}home, but my wife wants{3}her privacy back!{2}
I hated this place at first, but it's{3}grown on me. I feel so much more{3}sociable now...{2}
That guy's house isn't fixed,{3}and he won't help out on our{3}house until his is done.{2}
The mayor's been handing out{3}free food to help us all through{3}these difficult times.{1}The way things have been{3}going, though, I bet everyone{3}just hoards it all.{2}
We have to store what food we get{3}from the mayor and only eat a{3}little bit of it at a time.{2}
We could use some help with{3}the house, but it looks like{3}we're on our own for now.{2}
I don't know what will happen{3}if the repairs aren't done before{3}winter hits...{2}
I've seen Father trying to do some{3}repairs, but it's too much work{3}for him to do on his own.{2}
Even if we fix it, the columns{3}and the walls will collapse...{3}They always do...{2}
With everyone's help, we were{3}somehow able to avoid the wind{3}and rain at least.{1}You know, after all this, I now{3}understand how difficult it{3}is to be a carpenter.{2}
Mom was happy to hear that{3}the repairs were coming along{3}nicely. The thing is, they're not.{2}
There are a lot of houses in{3}need of repair. Until the others{3}are finished, I'll wait quietly.{2}
This is just too much work{3}for one man to get done.{1}I need to stop and get some{3}rest, but I promised I'd finish...{2}
He's never going to get{3}finished with that terrible{3}attitude of his.{1}Until he feels like working,{3}nothing much is going to{3}get done around here.{2}
There's no way Dad can fix{3}this house up all by himself.{3}It's a mess!{2}
Carrying these things all over has{3}gotten my hands all torn up.{3}I feel so...rugged!{2}
Everyone's saying that Briggs{3}probably escaped by tunneling{3}through the mayor's manor.{2}
Supposedly, the cave under the{3}mayor's manor is treacherous.{1}You'd have to be pretty tough{3}to make it out of there alive.{2}
So, Briggs stole Madra's ship{3}right out from under our{3}own greedy mayor?{1}Ah, 'tis an ill wind that...{3}that...um... Oh, I forget how it{3}goes. But it's bad, trust me.{2}
I don't know... I never really{3}thought the mayor would give{3}that boat to Madra anyway.{1}Our mayor's far too greedy to{3}pass up an opportunity like{3}this.{2}
The bridge to the west of{3}us is all fixed now, just so{3}you know.{2}
People will start traveling again,{3}and they'll need to buy equipment...{3}My equipment!{2}
We're still recovering from the{3}damage the tidal wave caused.{1}Once the reconstruction is{3}complete, Alhafra will be the{3}perfect town... Indestructible!{2}
The mayor used the money{3}he got from Madra to pay{3}for all our food.{1}Everything was looking good,{3}until the boat got stolen...{3}That sort of killed morale.{2}
It seems that Briggs broke{3}out of jail with the help{3}of his wife, Chaucha.{2}
Briggs might have had a{3}key, but I think he used{3}a different escape route...{1}I mean, walking out the{3}front door of our jail would{3}have been really stupid!{2}
A bigger boat could haul in{3}more fish, but right now, just{3}about anything will do!{2}
I just want a house where{3}we can all live together{3}without fighting!{2}
Someone said my son and my{3}grandchildren are fixing the{3}house. They're so considerate...{2}
So that Alex fellow left already,{3}did he? He's such a rogue... Is{3}he running from something?{2}
After the tidal wave, it was{3}one complaint after another,{3}but things have quieted down.{1}Everyone's been pulling together{3}to get this work done, and we've{3}set our differences aside.{2}
The mayor may have pulled{3}through the tidal wave just{3}fine, but his town didn't!{1}How could he even {9}{2}consider{7}{3}punishing me for trying to feed{3}all these unfortunate souls?{2}
Briggs and his wife were{3}totally planning this jailbreak{3}when she saw him there...{1}What was the guard doing?{3}Wasn't he watching his{3}prisoner? Was he napping?{2}
If I had a key, I would have{3}used it. That's for sure...{1}Briggs escaped through the{3}caves, though... That pirate's{3}a wily one.{2}
So what if trade brings people{3}here? Things are so bad, we{3}can't even offer a decent meal!{2}
I'd really like to have a pet, but{3}I know better. Things are too{3}tough right now.{2}
Isn't anyone helping my family{3}with the house? I'm an old man,{3}and it'll take them years to finish!{2}
He was just my type... Aloof,{3}strong, blue haired...{1}But he was a little too aloof.{3}He... He never even said{3}good-bye...{2}
I heard you were there when{3}Briggs escaped on the sailing{3}ship.{1}A villain like Briggs should{3}never have been allowed to{3}escape. It's a terrible thing.{2}
They were so confident when{3}they caught him before, but they{3}were careless and let him escape!{2}
Before I knew it, Chaucha stole{3}the keys to the jail, and Briggs{3}and his crew had them.{1}I never looked away! Not once!{3}I never let my guard down!{3}How did this happen?{2}
No matter how many times I go{3}over it, nothing seems right.{3}I'm just not convinced...{1}Wait a sec... Did Eoleo have a{3}hand in this? He was standing{3}behind me the entire time...{2}
The mayor of Alhafra does{3}not wish to meet with you.{3}Please step back.{2}
You really made a mess of{3}things. Letting Briggs get{3}away? What's wrong with you!?{1}The mayor trusted you! You{3}were his favorites{176}but not{3}anymore!{2}
The mayor was so mad at us{3}for letting Briggs reach the{3}boat.{1}How were we to know he{3}was going to steal it?{2}
One thing's for sure... We're not{3}going to be hearing about how{3}great {17}{5} is anymore!{1}Now it's my turn to show{3}the mayor what I can do!{2}
Briggs came through here and{3}disappeared into the forest.{3}Scared the pants clean off me!{2}
The poor guard was blindfolded{3}when Briggs escaped, so he{3}didn't see a thing.{1}He's smart, that Briggs,{3}covering his escape{3}route like that.{2}
Briggs came back with a{3}giant load of food! I've never{3}been so full! It feels great!{2}
Don't talk to me about food...{3}I feel like I'm gonna be sick.{2}
Let's see them call Champa{3}poor now!{1}Ever since Briggs came back{3}with a cargo of gems, we've{3}been filthy stinking rich!{2}
Hey, you just came to Champa{3}not too long ago, didn't you?{30}
You'll be pleased to know that{3}Briggs found ancient pirate{3}treasure and bought us all food!{2}
Well, you wouldn't know it to{3}look at us now, but Champa{3}was quite poor until recently.{1}Now, thanks to Briggs, we're{3}all so wealthy, it's disgusting!{2}
Briggs took a long time{3}to return to us. You want{3}to know why?{30}
He was being held by an evil{3}man who stole his money and{3}made him a prisoner!{1}They were probably trying{3}to find Briggs's jewels...{3}The sea is a rough place.{2}
Briggs overcame great{3}danger to return home to us.{3}I admire him. I really do.{2}
Briggs looks so reliable,{3}so sure of himself. I've never{3}seen him like this before.{2}
Those bags are full of food{3}for the people of Champa.{3}Briggs gave them to us.{2}
I want to play with Eoleo,{3}but he never comes down{3}to the harbor anymore.{2}
Briggs fought the odds to{3}bring us jewels and food!{3}He's an amazing leader!{2}
Obaba is the last possessor of{3}the ancient secrets of Ankhol,{3}a long-lost civilization...{1}There's nothing she can't fix,{3}no matter how broken it is.{3}She's quite the blacksmith!{2}
You'd think Obaba would be{3}glad that Briggs was back.{3}She acts like nothing's changed.{2}
Now, nobody has to do anything{3}he or she doesn't want to do!{3}We owe Briggs a lot of thanks.{2}
Briggs is so generous!{3}He told me to eat and eat{3}and eat, so I did!{2}
Errrrg... I was so full, and I{3}just kept eating. I think I'm{3}going to explode now.{2}
Gosh... How much are all{3}those jewels worth? More{3}than I can figure, I know that.{2}
Things are going to be different{3}around here. Things are going{3}to be better. I can't wait.{2}
We're lucky Briggs hadn't{3}found the jewels when he{3}was caught.{1}That would have been{3}the end of Champa.{2}
Briggs was always such{3}a brat, but now he's saved the{3}village! What a turnaround!{2}
All of our stockhouses are{3}so full of food that they've{3}just left the extra out here...{2}
Eoleo said he couldn't play{3}with us anymore, even though{3}he's younger than we are...{2}
If Champa gets enough money,{3}maybe we can stop with the{3}looting and pillaging...{2}
Is Obaba in a good mood now,{3}or what? I noticed the change{3}as soon as Briggs returned.{1}If you've got something to ask{3}her, now's the time to ask.{2}
Nobody really likes to play the{3}role of a pirate.{1}I'm sure everyone is glad they{3}don't have to anymore.{2}
We don't need to live off{3}fish anymore, so we don't{3}need any fishermen, do we?{1}That does it. I'm not{3}working anymore. What{3}would be the point?{2}
It's true! It's true! Briggs did{3}return with the jewels!{1}He's really going to have more{3}friends than he did before!{2}
Father's acting like a child, and it{3}seems he quit his job. He plans{3}on lounging around at home...{2}
When Briggs returned with the{3}jewels, the adults quit working.{3}I hope I don't become like them.{2}
I'd rather spend my time sleeping{3}than passing it chasing fish that{3}can't be caught.{1}Why go after food, when Briggs{3}can give it to you?{2} 
Briggs is a hero for saving the{3}village. But will Father lose his{3}motivation to be productive?{2}
If Father sits around the house, he{3}will lose all respectability. It's{3}better to fish than to do nothing.{2}
Quitting their jobs makes the{3}adults just like us kids. It's{3}getting really weird around here.{2}
I hear that Briggs sold the{3}jewels he found for cash and{3}then acquired a boat.{2}
While I'm grateful for the food,{3}it's somewhat annoying knowing{3}that Briggs saved the day.{2}
Briggs really saved our hides{3}this time, but I'm not about to{3}join his crew!{1}Yeah, maybe I do owe him for{3}this, but I'll find a way to{3}pay him back legitimately.{2}
The nerve of that Briggs!{3}He's gone for a bit, and he{3}comes back in a bigger boat!{1}I'll bet he only did it{3}to show us up, too!{2}
I should just sign up with{3}Briggs's crew and stop all{3}my complaining.{1}Oh, but my shipmates would{3}never forgive me if I bailed{3}on them like that.{2}
I refuse to live in the cliffs, and{3}therefore I am against Briggs.{1}I have accepted his food, but that{3}is as far as I will let myself slip.{2}
I've been wondering about{3}finding a chief for Champa,{3}since we don't have one.{1}If so, then Briggs would be the{3}favorite, since he's given{3}so much to the village.{2}
We village elders have guided{3}Champa for so many years...{1}Yes, times are changing. Perhaps{3}it's time Champa's leadership{3}was given to the sailors.{2}
A new image for Champa will{3}reflect the time we live in...{3}Any new visitors will like it...{2}
Observing Briggs recently,{3}the limits of Champa as a{3}village are very apparent.{1}From now on, the village will{3}develop through trade. I guess{3}that's the era we've come to.{2}
It seems the elders are{3}considering appointing Briggs{3}the first-ever chief of Champa.{2}
I, for one, think a person who can{3}bring the people of Champa{3}together will do us some good.{2}
Sure, Briggs saved the village.{3}But saving it from despair is not{3}the same as governing it...{2}
Supporting an entire village{3}through fishing from the sea{3}is next to impossible.{1}We need new sources of income.{3}Briggs is on the right path, finding{3}us all those lovely jewels.{2} 
Whoa! You... You're {17}{5}!{2}
What? Really?{3}It's {17}{5}?{2} 
You're awfully persistent,{3}aren't you?{2}
Briggs, get outta here!{3}{17}{5} is here to{3}finish you off!{2}
What was that!?{3}{17}{5}? Here?{2}
Oh no! It's really him! I've{3}got to get out of here!!!{2}
Why do you have to be so{3}stubborn? Quit following{3}us, you big bully!{2} 
All right, I surrender! I'll{3}go back to Alhafra...but{3}only if Briggs is going.{2}
I'd rather fight than go{3}back to jail.{3}Bring it on, sissyboy!{2}
Leave the women and{3}children alone. They've{3}got nothing to do with this.{2}
You're {17}{5}, aren't you?{3}You've come to bring in{3}Briggs, haven't you?{2}
Did you really think you could{3}come storming into Champa,{3}Briggs's home, without a fight?{2}
Aw, come on! I'm not doing{3}anything! Leave me alone!{2}
What, you want to come in?{30}
As if! I'm a nice girl, and I'm{3}not about to let some masher{3}come storming into my room!{2}
Yeah? So what do you want?{3}You're wasting my time.{2}
Why's everyone so scared of{3}you? You don't look so tough.{2}
If you so much as {9}{2}touch{7} me,{3}I'll bite your nose off!{2}
Maybe if I pretend he's not there,{3}he'll go away. I don't want to fight{3}him... He's got creepy powers!{2}
He's after our ship, isn't he?{3}That no-good thief mayor{3}must have sent him.{2}
It would be so much easier just{3}to go back to jail. Yeah... They{3}can't beat me up if I surrender!{2}
What are they doing here?{3}Do they mean to capture us?{2}
Briggs said the guy who{3}captured him was some amazingly{3}tough thug named {17}{5}.{1}But I don't know... If this really{3}is him, he doesn't look like the{3}bad guy Briggs said he was.{2}
Why would Briggs run away{3}like a little baby just because{3}this guy showed up?{2}
Briggs is pretty tough. This guy{3}must be a serious monster if he{3}beat the captain...{2}
Tough or not, he's not getting{3}past me without a beating.{2}
He's not so tough! Why's everyone{3}running away? Just thump him{3}good and be done with it.{2}
What's he staring at? Sheesh!{3}This guy's a total lech!{2}
Hold it right there!{2}
So, {17}{5}, you've come.{2}
Don't assume I'll go so{3}easy on you this time!{2}
Is that boy him? The "mighty{3}warrior" you told me about?{2}
I told you he didn't look{3}like much, Grandma...{2}
Weren't you even{3}listening to me?{2}
All you told me is that his name{3}is {17}{5} and that he is{3}a "mighty warrior." Hmph.{2}
He doesn't look like the sort{3}of person who's interested in{3}stealing our jewels, though.{2}
But that's not the{3}point, Grandma!{2}
If you don't destroy him now,{3}he's going to take me far away,{3}and you won't ever see me again!{2}
Oh, now he doesn't look like the{3}kind of boy who would do that...{2}
If he takes me away, poor{3}Eoleo will be so sad! What{3}do you say about that, huh?{2}
Oh, that's just not fair.{3}You know I can't deny my{3}darling great-grandson!{2}
I don't see why I should be the{3}one to get you out of this mess,{3}but I can't bear to see Eoleo sad.{2}
Grandma, please!{2}
Oh, all right. Listen, you have no{3}idea what you're getting into.{3}I think you'd better leave.{30}
Ah, you've made a good decision.{3}You seem like a reasonable boy.{3}Reasonable boys live longer.{2}
Stubborn, are you? Ah, well.{3}If that's the way it's going to{3}be, get ready for your medicine!{2}
Heart of the earth, fury of the{3}forge's flames, grant me power!{2}
Have you learned your{3}lesson, {17}{5}?{2}
Ah, such a bright lad. Now then,{3}don't you ever try to take my{3}Briggs away ever again!{2}
Back for more?{2}
I wouldn't be doing this if it{3}weren't for Eoleo, you know.{2}
I'm sorry. You look like quite a{3}nice boy, but I just can't allow{3}you to take my Briggs away.{2}
My salamander! You...{3}beat my salamander...{2}
I thought he was unbeatable...{3}How could this be?{2}
How did you do that?{3}What... What are you?{2}
Grandma, what's going on!?{3}I thought you were going{3}to protect me!{2}
What do you mean, what am I{3}doing? I've done everything I can!{2}
Grandma!!! He's going to take{3}me away! He's a bad guy! You{3}have to do {9}{2}something{7}!{2}
I'm sorry, Briggs, but you'll{3}have to fight him yourself.{2}
Wha-What!?{2}
You heard me. I'm through{3}pampering you. You have to{3}get out of this yourself!{2}
But...Grandma... Look at him!{3}I mean, look what he can do!{2}
I know, dear, but there's nothing{3}I can do to help. You don't want{3}him to take you away, do you?{2}
But...what about poor Eoleo?{2}
*Sigh*{3}All right, all right.{2}
Um. Excuse me... There seems{3}to be a small misunderstanding.{2}
Yeah! I don't like standing here{3}listening to a pirate call {9}{2}us{7}{3}the bad guys!{2}
Pirate! My Briggs?{2}
He stole a ship from Alhafra{3}and escaped from their jail!{3}A ship {9}{2}we{7} helped fix!{2}
Briggs, is this true?{2}
Aw... But, Grandma, they...{2}
We should tell you, we're{3}not here to take Briggs{3}back to Alhafra.{2}
So you've decided you don't{3}want to run errands for the{3}mayor of Alhafra?{30}
Good. That greedy bag of hot{3}air can do his own dirty work,{3}for all I care.{2}
{17}{5}, I know you can't{3}mean that. We didn't come to{3}Champa for that bloated gasbag.{2}
Briggs... Piracy? Why?{2}
Grandma, it's not what you{3}think! These guys, they...{2}
Briggs, you just hush up!!!{3}{5}...It all makes sense now. The{3}gems, the food, your absence...{2}
What do you mean?{3}What makes sense?{2}
They're telling the truth! And{3}you, Briggs! You've been{3}lying to me this whole time!{2}
You're going to take their word{3}over your own grandson's?{2}
You got that right! I should{3}have known better than to{3}believe you, you scoundrel!{2}
He only did it for Champa!{2}
Chaucha!{2}
You came!{2}
I heard {17}{5} had shown{3}up looking for you. I was{3}worried...{2}
What did you mean, Briggs{3}did it for Champa?{2}
All of that food...{3}Stolen goods?{2}
No, we paid for everthing we{3}brought back with us.{2}
But you stole a boat to{3}do it, didn't you?{2}
Grandma, we found those jewels{3}ourselves, and we paid Alhafra{3}well for that ship, didn't we?{30}
Your story has the{3}ring of truth to it.{2}
Thank you, {17}{5}. Your{3}honesty speaks well of you.{2}
So he's lying again?{2}
Dang it, {17}{5}, I'm{3}not lying!{2}
We...were pirates, for a short{3}while. Until we found the jewels.{2}
But if not for our efforts,{3}Champa would have starved{3}away long ago.{2}
But that doesn't excuse{3}resorting to piracy!{2}
Hey, it's not like we were{3}doing it for the money! We{3}wanted to save Champa!{2}
Those jewels we found are very{3}valuable. We intend to repay{3}each town we...borrowed from.{2}
Isn't that true?{2}
What's the matter with you!?{3}You said on the boat that we{3}would repay every last town!{2}
Oh yeah... You're right...{3}We really ought to try to make{3}amends for what we've done.{2}
That's the truth, Grandmother.{3}Can you find it in your heart{3}to forgive your only grandson?{2}
All right, all right. I'm too old for{3}grudges. But what about {17}{5}?{2}
What do you say, {17}{5}?{3}Can you forgive my husband?{30}
I agree, {17}{5}. If each{3}town is repaid what was stolen,{3}I see no reason for complaint.{2}
I don't know, {17}{5}.{3}We didn't come to capture{3}Briggs. Why should we care?{2}
Do you hear that? They forgive{3}you, too. That means you can{3}leave Eoleo with nothing to fear.{2}
I... I don't know what to say...{2}
You know, you look a{3}little strange...{2}
Oh... Oh, really?{2}
You haven't caught a{3}cold, have you? Do you{3}have a fever?{2}
What are you talking about?{2}
No, I'm positive... You look{3}flush, too... You'd better lie{3}down before it gets worse.{2}
She...worries about me.{2}
Hurry up and get into bed{3}so you can get some rest!{2}
Oh, for goodness' sake! You{3}don't want to give them your{3}cold, do you? Come on!{2}
So...what brings you{3}to Champa?{2}
I mean, you didn't come here{3}to catch Briggs, from what{3}I gathered...{2}
Ah, well... To be young and{3}foolish again.{1}If you ever need to consult with{3}me on any number of subjects,{3}you're welcome anytime.{2}
I mean it. If there's ever{3}anything you need, just{3}call on me. I'm always here.{2}
Now I've done it. I said I'd help{3}them with anything, but I'm only{3}good at fixing broken things...{2}
This looks like a weapon!{2}
It looks like part of a trident,{3}but it's only one third of the{3}whole thing, it seems...{2}
Why... Could it be? Is this{3}the legendary trident of{3}Ankohl?{2}
I'll hold on to this for you. It{3}won't do you any good like{3}this, and I'll keep it safe here.{2}
You seem unsure... You don't{3}think I'll pull a fast one on you,{3}do you?{30}
Kids today. So mistrustful.{2}
Ah, that's nice.{3}Don't you worry!{2}
If you bring me the other{3}two pieces, I'll be happy{3}to rebuild it for you.{2}
The legend says that anyone{3}who holds the whole lance has{3}nothing to fear from the sea.{2}
All of my smithing knowledge and{3}training was solely so that I might{3}rebuild the legendary trident.{1}I can't wait to get all three{3}pieces and repair the ancient{3}weapon of Ankohl.{2}
Ah, have you found the{3}second piece, dear?{2}
It's magnificent!{2}
I'll hold on to this as well.{3}Wouldn't want it getting lost,{3}now would we? Only one to go!{2}
Yes, there's no doubt about it.{3}Those must truly be fragments{3}of the legendary trident.{2}
Soon, I'll have the chance to{3}test my skills to their fullest{3}extent! I can hardly wait!{2}
Well done! You found all{3}three pieces of the trident!{2}
That means I can begin{3}work reforging the ancient{3}trident of Ankohl! At last!{2}
We'll just toss all three{3}pieces in here, shall we?{30}
Just leave it to me...{2}
There's nothing to be afraid{3}of, dear. Just leave it to me.{2}
Heart of the earth, fury of the{3}forge's flames, grant me power!{2}
That's funny... Nothing happened.{2}
What's going on?{2}
Something's happening!{3}Is that...the legendary trident?{2}
After all these years, the trident{3}is complete again. But what's{3}making it float like that?{2}
Regardless, the trident has{3}been fixed. It belongs to you{3}now, {17}{5}. Use it well.{2}
The trident seems to have some{3}amazing power... The legends{3}must be true...{1}No matter what you encounter{3}at sea, no monster can stand{3}against you with that trident.{2}
You guys don't look much like{3}warriors, but you sure are{3}brave to fight your way in here.{2}
Why did you have to go and tell{3}Obaba that we were pirates?{3}I'll bet that really upset her.{2}
Aren't you the ones who caught{3}Briggs in Alhafra? You don't{3}look it, but you're pretty tough.{2}
When Briggs set sail, we{3}thought we'd never see him{3}again.{1}Now, all of a sudden, he shows{3}up, and with enough food to{3}save our town forever!{2}
I think those guys down in{3}the harbor wanted to come{3}up here and join us...{1}All they have to do is ask,{3}but I think they're chicken...{2}
We have so much food{3}everywhere now!{1}I hope Briggs goes off{3}soon to bring us even{3}more jewels and treats!{2}
Briggs came down with a{3}cold. I guess that means he{3}won't be sailing for a while.{2}
Eoleo still won't come down{3}and play with us. I'm getting{3}really cheesed off at him.{2}
Once I'm over my cold, I'm setting{3}out to get more jewels and make{3}amends with Madra and Daila.{2}
I wonder what's wrong with{3}Briggs. He was feeling so{3}healthy and happy.{1}He doesn't have a fever, and{3}he's not coughing, but he says{3}he's too weak to go out.{2}
Babu ba bubabu...{2}
We're going to wait until{3}Briggs feels better before{3}we go out to sea again.{2}
There were plenty of treasures{3}on that island in the middle of{3}the sea.{1}If we get tired of waiting{3}for Briggs, maybe you{3}could come with us.{2}
We really want to make{3}amends. We just need{3}Briggs to get better.{2}
It's all my fault. If I hadn't{3}messed with that switch,{3}we'd have gotten everything.{2}
All of my training was for the{3}single purpose of reforging{3}the ancient trident.{2}
{17}{5} must be incredibly{3}strong to get Briggs all{3}worked up like that.{2}
I just know she's going to{3}yell at us. The waiting is the{3}worst part. Next to the yelling.{2}
That {17}{5} sure comes off{3}kind of high and mighty. I hate{3}those self-righteous types.{2}
I was just gazing out at sea,{3}and then I saw Briggs's{3}ship... I got all choked up.{2}
All those sailors who didn't{3}join Briggs said they didn't{3}want to be pirates.{1}Now that Briggs's going{3}straight, they want to join him.{3}I think they're just cowards.{2}
Briggs says he's sick and{3}can't go to sea right now.{1}But how can he not go? He{3}has to make up for all of{3}his evil deeds...{2}
Briggs's never been sick{3}a day in his life. I wonder how{3}he caught a cold now...{2}
Eoleo is younger than I am,{3}but he acts like he's a lot{3}older.{2}
I'm certain that there are{3}even more jewels back in{3}that cave!{1}If only I'd had the chance to{3}grab a few more before that{3}trap blocked our way!{2}
There is absolutely nothing{3}wrong with Briggs.{1}I just know he's hiding{3}something from me...{2}
One of Papa's men touched a{3}trap, and that's why Papa{3}couldn't get all the jewels.{1}Papa, I think you should{3}tell {17}{5} about that.{2}
Suppose we went to get the{3}jewels... How would we gather{3}them, with that trap in the way?{2}
Briggs is just pretending to{3}be sick because he doesn't{3}want to follow up on his promise.{2}
I was as shocked as the next{3}guy that we couldn't reach{3}those treasure chests...{2}
At least we got some of{3}the jewels before that stupid{3}switch blocked us off.{2}
The jewels Briggs found{3}are truly remarkable.{1}I wonder if there are any{3}more like these in that cave.{2}
Thanks to Briggs, the Champa{3}can eat again!{1}Unfortunately, all that food is{3}going to run out someday.{3}Then, what do we do?{2}
Briggs's men said they found{3}amazing weapons and things{3}in the cave, too...{1}I wish I'd been there. I would{3}like to have seen them...{2}
Now's the time we ought to{3}be working hardest. While we{3}can eat, Champa can flourish.{2}
We still haven't been able{3}to catch any fish for dinner.{1}Not to worry, though. We'll{3}serve up the meat that{3}Briggs bought for us!{2}
It's nice not having to{3}work, but it gets a little{3}boring after a while.{2}
Most people here would love{3}a nice fish meal, but having{3}red meat is a nice change.{2}
The only way to find your{3}special purpose in life{3}is to work hard.{2}
Briggs's jewels have turned{3}this poor town into a wealthy{3}place, but he brought too many.{1}Now, the hardworking people of{3}Champa have learned to be{3}lazy louts.{2}
All the people in town think{3}they can live without ever{3}having to work again.{1}They've quit their jobs,{3}and they rely too heavily{3}on Briggs's find.{2}
Hold on to that tiller!{3}Do you want us to get{3}swallowed by the waves!?{2}
I know you're worried,{3}{17}{7}, but he's doing{3}the best he can...{2}
That was an incredibly strong{3}whirlpool, but I doubt it could{3}sink us or destroy the ship.{2}
See, {17}{7}? There's nothing to{3}worry about. Even if we hit a{3}whirlpool, we should be fine.{2}
But still... {17}{8}, can't you show{3}{17}{5} how to get past the{3}whirlpools and into Lemuria?{2}
Er, yes, well...{2}
What's wrong, {17}{8}?{3}Lemuria's just beyond these{3}whirlpools, isn't it?{2}
Yeah, I...think so...{2}
You..."think so"!?{2}
Aren't you...{9}{2}from{7} Lemuria?{3}Shouldn't you know exactly{3}where it is?{2}
Yes, I'm from Lemuria... I've{3}never had to get back {9}{2}into{7}{3}it before!{1}And besides, the tidal wave{3}carried me out of Lemuria.{3}I didn't come through here.{2}
Oh, I see. So that must mean...{3}You don't actually know which{3}direction Lemuria is in, do you?{2}
Don't be silly! I mean...{3}I just need to get my bearings.{2}
Hm... That doesn't sound good.{2}
If Lemuria really is beyond those{3}currents, then we'll need to find{3}a way to get through them.{2}
And until we do...{2}
We won't be getting into Lemuria.{2}
Why, that was Psynergy,{3}wasn't it?{2}
Are they Adepts?{2}
Who {9}{2}are{7} you!?{2}
Are you the ones who{3}defeated Poseidon?{30}
That's quite something! Who{3}are you, that you could{3}defeat that leviathan?{2}
But clearly, you are here,{3}and the beast is gone...{2}
If you are strong enough to{3}defeat Poseidon, you are too{3}dangerous to enter Lemuria.{2}
The king's orders are clear!{3}We cannot grant you entry.{2}
King? Who is your king?{2}
His Highness, King Hydros,{3}of course...{2}
His Majesty has ruled over{3}Lemuria for centuries.{2}
King Hydros has decreed that{3}Lemuria must be kept safe{3}from dangerous outsiders.{2}
You say that we are dangerous,{3}but do you include me as well?{2}
{17}{8}!{30}
{17}{8}!{2}
Did you join them in battle{3}against Poseidon?{2}
Impossible! Everyone knows{3}you possess great courage, but{3}you still are a mere Lemurian!{2}
Such comments do us all a{3}great disservice! I battled{3}fiercely alongside my friends!{2}
Leave our landing to me.{2}
You have my word that we{3}shall create no problems{3}during our stay.{1}Will you not permit us to enter?{2}
{17}{8}, I know you are a{3}man of your word, but the king's{3}orders must stand!{2}
You understand that we cannot{3}simply ignore the king's orders,{3}don't you, {17}{8}?{2}
What is King Hydros doing...{2}
So, you people really take your{3}kings seriously, don't you?{2}
Insolent pup! Do not dishonor{3}the king of Lemuria! We are{3}peaceful, but quick to anger!{2}
Pup? I must be twice your{3}age! Who are you calling{3}"pup"?{2}
You wish to see Lemuria, and yet{3}you know so little of us! I am far{3}older than you. Show respect!{2}
Pah! Older than me?!{3}Inconceivable!{2}
Er... Actually, Kraden, these{3}two are perhaps older than{3}all of you combined...{2}
Babi must have spoken of this{3}to you. In Lemuria, time passes{3}quite slowly.{2}
Ah... Well... I suppose I recall{3}something of that sort or{3}another... Maybe...{1}But to imagine for a moment{3}that these two gentlemen are{3}older than I am? It's a bit much!{2}
But perhaps I was rude, and{3}I hope you accept my apology.{3}My ignorance misled me.{2}
Well, just so long as we're{3}clear on that.{2}
But if your fighting is as skilled{3}as your wordplay, then perhaps{3}you aren't so dangerous to us.{2}
I agree. Perhaps His Majesty{3}will provide an exception in{3}their case.{2}
King Hydros might be willing{3}to reverse his order if we{3}confer with him, wouldn't he?{2}
We shall speak with{3}him at once!{2}
King Hydros has been seeking{3}news from beyond the Sea of{3}Time. He will want to see you.{2}
Wait here.{2}
How long do you think{3}we'll be waiting?{2}
Good point. Time means little{3}to most Lemurians.{1}Mere moments to us could{3}seem like a lifetime to outsiders.{2}
You seem young to me, and{3}yet you are probably an old{3}man among your people...{1}I would imagine that you have{3}probably done enough waiting{3}in your lifetime.{2}
King Hydros instructed us to be{3}kind to the elderly at all times.{2}
They seem trustworthy enough...{3}Shall we let them in?{2}
I can see no reason not to.{3}We won't get in trouble, will we?{2}
I will be with them! Now,{3}please, let me walk the streets{3}of my home once more!{2}
I beseech you!{2}
Then we place our trust in{3}each of you. You may enter.{3}But...don't do anything rash!{2}
If you cause any trouble, we'll{3}hunt you down and exact{3}swift and terrible vengeance.{2}
Do we have your word?{30}
Ooo! Ooo! Finally! What could{3}be waiting for me in Lemuria?{3}I can't wait another moment!{2}
We've come a long way{3}to see Lemuria. I won't have{3}anything ruin it for me now!{2}
But thank you for speaking{3}honestly. Sometimes, you can{3}say the weirdest things...{1}I was actually a little bit{3}worried, to tell you truly.{2}
What!? Are you INSANE!? Or{3}maybe you think you're funny?{3}Because you're not!{1}Maybe this whole quest is{3}just a game to you, but it's{3}not to me! Are you bored!?{1}Do you want to go home!?{3}FINE! That's it! Then let's{3}go home!{2}
Oh, hush. I'll keep a close{3}eye on them. You have{3}nothing to fear.{2}
Very well, {17}{8}. We place{3}our faith in you, then.{3}Enter freely and peacably.{2}
You must already be aware of{3}this, but you are not permitted{3}to enter the palace.{2}
If the king were to find out about{3}this, we'd be in big trouble.{2}
Don't worry! I won't let{3}that happen.{2}
Is this Hydros really{3}so fearsome?{2}
Fearsome isn't the right word...{3}King Hydros has lived longer{3}than anyone. He is most wise.{2}
While everyone respects{3}him and holds him in great{3}reverence...{1}It would be a mistake to{3}call it fear.{2}
I certainly do not fear him.{3}The king... He...{2}
He what?{2}
You will understand once you{3}meet the king yourself.{2}
But that does not matter{3}now. Let's go!{2}
To Lemuria... The city you've{3}all been longing to see...{2}
Lost already, {17}{5}? That's{3}the way to the boat dock! You{3}can't want to return already!{1}We've only just gotten to{3}Lemuria. We can't leave yet!{3}There's still so much to see!{2}
Lost already, {17}{5}? That's{3}the way to the boat dock! You{3}can't want to return already!{1}We've only just gotten to{3}Lemuria. We can't leave yet!{3}There's still so much to see!{2}
This place is remarkable...{3}Truly remarkable...{2}
Who goes there! I've not{3}seen you in Lemuria before!{2}
Wait a moment...{2}
You must be the travelers{3}who arrived with {17}{8}. Is{3}your name {17}{5}, perchance?{2}
{17}{8}?{3}You mean {17}{8},{3}the Lost One?{2}
Have I earned a title in my{3}absence? Well, worry not!{3}{17}{8} is lost no more!{2}
I seek counsel with King Hydros.{3}Has His Highness been{3}told of my return?{2}
Word was sent, but I do not{3}know if it has reached the king.{2}
What do you mean?{2}
Lord Conservato is meeting{3}with His Highness as we speak.{2}
Not Conservato...{2}
What's wrong, {17}{8}? You{3}don't look pleased to hear{3}that name...{2}
Kraden... What do you think of{3}what you have seen of Lemuria?{2}
It is a magnificent city!{3}Or do you mean the castle?{3}Both are magnificent!{2}
And you, {17}{5}?{3}Do you agree?{30}
Any newcomer to our town{3}would doubtless feel the{3}same at first.{2}
Ah! Yes, you marvel not at its{3}present condition, but at the{3}greater splendor of its past!{2}
In ages past, Lemuria was a{3}far lovelier, more grand, and{3}more lively city.{2}
His Highness, the king, tells of{3}days gone by, of a more brilliant{3}Lemuria long before my birth.{2}
Over the countless years,{3}our people have lost vigor,{3}enthusiasm, creativity...{1}Lemuria has fallen into{3}slow collapse, a city that{3}has lost its spark...{2}
Lemuria as you see it{3}is only a shadow of the{3}city of legend.{2}
If only I had the chance to see{3}the city in all its splendor. But{3}how does Conservato figure in?{2}
King Hydros believes that our{3}decay is related in some way{3}to Alchemy.{2}
Alchemy!?{2}
King Hydros wants to find a{3}way to stop the ruin of{3}Lemuria.{2}
If there were anything we{3}could do to help stop it,{3}we would.{2}
But the senators are unwilling{3}to take action! They're stubborn,{3}and they fear any change...{2}
Senate? What is a senate?{2}
The senate is the group of{3}elders who determine policy{3}in Lemuria.{2}
Lord Conservato holds the{3}highest office in the senate.{2}
The senate usually opposes{3}any new ideas or proposals{3}introduced before it...{2}
Word of our arrival will never{3}reach the king as long as{3}Conservato has his ear.{2}
And his conversations with the{3}king are incredibly long.{2}
We have no choice but{3}to wait patiently here.{2}
Why don't we spend our{3}time looking around Lemuria{3}until then...{2}
The king is holding counsel with{3}Lord Conservato right now.{1}It might be a while before{3}you can see him.{2}
The king will be thrilled to hear{3}his trusted {17}{8} has{3}returned.{2}
How much longer will Conservato{3}be in there? They've been talking{3}for ages now.{2}
I had heard {17}{8} was{3}back, but I didn't believe it until{3}now...{1}You seem much more confident,{3}{17}{8}. Everyone has been{3}noticing it.{2}
I cannot remember the last{3}time we had visitors in Lemuria.{3}Not in a great while, certainly.{2}
Lemuria has no disease, no{3}war... Anyone who saw it would{3}think it a paradise.{1}And yet...all who come to our{3}city seek to leave soon after{3}arriving. I, too, wish to leave.{2}
In Lemuria, we do not grow old.{3}It must seem quite odd to{3}those from the outside world.{2}
Life never changes here in{3}Lemuria. It can get rather{3}dull, you'll find.{2}
I ought to feel surprised to{3}see outsiders here, but I can't{3}remember how to be surprised.{2}
How old am I again? I quit{3}counting after I turned two{3}hundred, and that was long ago.{2}
It has been many, many years{3}since a new child was born{3}in Lemuria.{1}Lemurians love children, but{3}they only remain children for{3}such a short time.{2}
We are the only children in{3}Lemuria. I often wish there were{3}other children to play with.{2}
Meow... Mrrrfle...{2}
Woof! ...rrrrrROOF!{2}
Moo.{2}
Bukbukbuk...{2}
...{2}
More of the same, today and{3}every day. Nothing around{3}here ever changes.{2}
I haven't been surprised in{3}ages. I don't know what I'd{3}do if something happened.{2}
I've aged so slowly, I no longer{3}fear death, but at the same time,{3}I have no motivation at all.{2}
Sometimes, I think the buildings{3}fall apart faster than we age.{2}
Long ago, a man named Lunpa{3}drifted to our island. That was{3}quite a surprise.{1}Someone else came with him,{3}but he fled so quickly.{3}What was his name again?{2}
King Hydros is far older{3}even than I am...{3}How old is he?{2}
Everyone spoils me so much...{3}I don't ever want to grow up!{1}But in another 20 or 30 years,{3}I will be an adult. Oh well. At{3}least it's some kind of change.{2}
Are there other children in the{3}lands beyond the Sea of Time?{3}Are there other people?{2}
No one in Lemuria feels any{3}passion for anything. They're{3}lazier than a cat in a sunbeam.{2}
There's so much treasure buried{3}here that you could dig almost{3}anywhere and find something...{1}So why doesn't anybody{3}here dig?{2}
Lemurians are so lazy that{3}they make me look like a{3}dynamo. And they live so long!{2}
If it weren't for the people in{3}the castle, the Lemurians would{3}probably let themselves starve.{2}
Mother... Why have you{3}left me...{2}
I have never been outside of{3}Lemuria. I don't know what the{3}rest of the world is like.{1}If there weren't laws prohibiting{3}us from leaving, I would be gone{3}in an instant.{2}
Now that {17}{8} has returned,{3}maybe he'll share his tales{3}of the outside world with me.{2}
Who knows what wonders lie{3}across the Sea of Time... I'd{3}love to know, but...{1}I can't stand places with{3}little culture and no advanced{3}civilization.{2}
The senate passed the law that{3}prohibits us from leaving...{1}But {17}{8} was carried out{3}to sea by the tidal wave. He{3}can't be blamed for that...{2}
Are you the travelers that came{3}here with {17}{8}?{30}
No? Ah, interesting. I wonder{3}when {17}{8} will come to{3}see me.{2}
I was{176}what is the word?{176}{3}surprised when I heard{3}{17}{8} had returned.{1}I hope that I get to{3}see him soon.{2}
I am sorry it has taken{3}me so long to visit, Uncle.{2}
{17}{8}! You are alive!{2}
Yes, I've managed to survive{3}against a great many trials.{2}
What a fascinating coincidence!{1}We've stumbled across {17}{8}'s{3}uncle's house!{2}
I must thank you all for{3}looking after my nephew.{2}
This is {17}{5} and Kraden.{3}They are my friends, and{3}have aided me tremendously.{2}
If my sister could only hear{3}how timid young {17}{8}{3}has become a mighty warrior...{2}
Where is my mother? We've been{3}so busy since we arrived that I{3}haven't had a chance to see her.{2}
Now that I think about it, this{3}place is a mess. What happened?{3}Mother is always so neat...{2}
...No! She hasn't...fallen ill{3}again, has she?{2}
There is still illness{3}in Lemuria?{2}
My mother was born with{3}a weak heart...{2}
{17}{8}... I'm sorry... Your return{3}comes too late...{2}
After the tidal wave washed{3}you to sea, your mother{3}suddenly fell ill...{2}
The shock of losing you was{3}too great for her poor heart.{2}
She held out hope for your{3}safe return until the very end.{2}
Perhaps your mother gave{3}herself up to ensure your{3}survival...{2}
Does that not sound like{3}your mother?{2}
Where is she now?{2}
She rests in the cemetery now.{3}Check the headstones... You{3}will find her.{2}
What should we do, {17}{5}?{3}Should we follow {17}{8}?{30}
After all we've been through,{3}the least we can do is offer{3}{17}{8} our condolences.{2}
You're right. {17}{8} probably{3}needs some time alone right now.{2}
I am so relieved that {17}{8}{3}has returned to me alive.{1}He is the last of my relatives.{3}Without him, I would be alone.{2}
Poor {17}{8}...{3}Being born in Lemuria and{3}gifted with long life...{1}Only to lose his father in his youth{3}and his mother now. He faces{3}many long years of loneliness.{2}
Wait...{2}
I ask that you leave {17}{8}{3}to his mourning for now...{2}
Now he is struggling with{3}the loss of his mother.{3}He needs time.{2}
You came to Lemuria to learn{3}more of Alchemy, did you not?{2}
I suspected as much. {17}{8}{3}was right to bring you here.{2}
{17}{8} told me his secret...{3}The mission he was given{3}by His Highness the king.{2}
Even had the tidal wave not{3}carried {17}{8} off, he would{3}have left us... Such was his fate.{2}
You look confused...{3}{17}{8} told you about{3}this, did he not?{30}
Of course... He must trust{3}you a great deal.{2}
Curious... I can't understand{3}why he would do that...{2}
If Lord Conservato had not led{3}the senate to oppose him,{3}he would have left sooner.{2}
I wonder what news {17}{8}{3}has brought with him.{2}
Either way, I do know why{3}he has brought you here.{2}
{17}{5}... Don't tell me that{3}he hasn't at least told you{3}that much!{30}
You say he's told you, but{3}you look rather confused.{2}
Did {17}{8} tell you nothing{3}before bringing you here{3}to Lemuria?{2}
Unfortunately, I know little{3}more than that...{2}
While {17}{8} confronts his{3}sorrow over the loss of his{3}mother, you have some time...{2}
I shall write you a letter...{2}
So that you can see Lunpa...{2}
Lunpa has locked himself in his{3}tower and rarely comes out, but{3}if I send him this, he will see you.{2}
All I need is a bird to carry{3}it to him in his tower.{2}
There. You should be able{3}to see him now.{2}
Go to Lunpa's tower. He{3}will see you.{2}
Lunpa has given the king{3}tremendous aid on this matter.{3}He will have much to tell them.{2}
House of the Senate{2}
Are you the warriors from{3}beyond the Sea of Time who{3}returned with {17}{8}?{30}
What can you uncivilized louts{3}hope to bring to Lemuria?{2}
Only savages and barbarians are{3}wont to tell lies when confronted{3}with uncomfortable situations.{2}
Long ago, the power of Alchemy{3}was abused in ways that might{3}bring about the end of the world.{1}Because it was sealed away, the{3}king claims, the world has begun{3}to wither and decay.{2}
And now, rumors abound of a{3}group of fools who are actually{3}attempting to restore Alchemy.{1}It is only because Alchemy{3}was sealed away that the world{3}has enjoyed this lasting peace.{2}
Come what may, I cannot{3}approve of anyone setting{3}Alchemy loose on the world.{2}
Has Lemuria fallen into decay,{3}I ask you!? Nay!{1}Only by casting aside Alchemy{3}has the world been saved{3}from itself!{2}
Do you seek to know more{3}about the draughts that provide{3}us with such longevity?{30}
Once, Lemurians bottled special{3}draughts to leave here and{3}travel through Weyard...{1}A man named Babi stole{3}the remainder of our precious{3}draughts and fled Lemuria.{2}
Then I shall tell you this:{3}So long as we drink of the{3}Lemurian Spring, we live long.{1}We no longer leave our home,{3}so we have no need to make{3}our draughts of old.{2}
Was that some form{3}of Psynergy?{30}
Ho ho ho! We Lemurians are{3}masters of Psynergy all! Your{3}powers are not special here.{2}
No? Curious. But it does not{3}matter. Lemurians are masters{3}of Psynergy. It is of no import.{2}
What does Hydros think will{3}happen if he sets Alchemy{3}loose on the world again!?{2}
Ever since Alchemy was sealed,{3}time itself has seemed frozen.{1}In my mind's eye, I do not{3}see anyone who will go along{3}with the king's plan.{2}
If Alchemy were loosed upon the{3}world, people would fight again{3}to control the Stone of Sages.{1}Alchemy must remain sealed{3}away, if for no other reason{3}than to avoid this strife.{2}
All of the members of the{3}senate must remain opposed{3}to breaking the seal.{1}As long as we remain united,{3}King Hydros cannot take any{3}action to complete his plan.{2}
Certainly, Lemuria has lost{3}some of the splendor that{3}once filled its streets.{1}But to think that Alchemy{3}could restore this is{3}madness itself!{2}
Even though we no longer{3}prepare the draught, the water{3}of our spring sustains us...{2}
The door doesn't want to open.{2}
Are you kids {17}{8}'s{3}traveling companions?{2}
The door's broken,{3}I'm afraid.{2}
But I opened up a window{3}just above the door.{2}
Sorry about this, but you'll{3}have to climb through there.{2}
Honestly, I'm amazed that{3}anyone can travel so far{3}across the world in this age.{2}
Say, {17}{8} isn't with{3}you! Er...why not?{2}
His mother passed away...{3}He's gone to visit her grave.{2}
Of course... His mother... He{3}loved her dearly. A terrible{3}loss... It must be hard on him.{2}
Well, {17}{8} may not be here, but{3}we still have much to discuss.{2}
If {17}{8} brought you,{3}you must be working to break{3}the seal on Alchemy, right?{30}
Ah, {17}{8} has done quite{3}well in finding you!{2}
That doesn't make sense... He{3}wouldn't have brought you to{3}Lemuria if you weren't helping.{2}
What mission could the good{3}King Hydros have assigned{3}to {17}{8}?{2}
What? {17}{8} has told you{3}nothing of his mission?{2}
...Really?{2}
So you actually have nothing{3}at all to do with Alchemy!?{2}
Our parents were kidnapped by{3}the Fire Clan, far to the north.{1}We are only firing the lighthouse{3}beacons to gain their freedom...{2}
King Hydros told me that Venus{3}and Mercury have been ignited{3}once again. Was that your doing?{2}
I'm afraid I know nothing of{3}any northern "Fire Clan."{2}
But that doesn't explain you, sir.{3}You're clearly not related to{3}these two. What are your goals?{2}
Kraden joined us on this quest{3}on behalf of Lord Babi of Tolbi.{2}
...Babi?{2}
I only know of one man named{3}Babi... But it couldn't...{2}
Master Lunpa, the Babi we{3}speak of is the same man{3}you knew long ago.{2}
Ah! So...he's still out there,{3}living in the outside world?{2}
Well, that might not be the{3}most accurate way of putting it.{2}
Most...accurate? My, you{3}certainly have an odd way{3}of turning a phrase...{2}
He was living, yes...{3}Until recently, that is...{2}
So, Babi passed away...{3}But only recently, you say?{2}
When he finally ran out of{3}his mystic draughts, his spirit{3}began to wane.{2}
Then...I no longer know anyone{3}in the world outside.{2}
But... Aren't you Lunpa, the{3}Righteous Thief?{2}
I was called that once, long,{3}long ago. Why do you ask?{2}
I'll bet there's at least one{3}person in the outside world{3}whom you still know.{2}
Who would that be?{2}
There's a town called Lunpa{3}in northern Angara. A man{3}named Donpa lives there.{2}
I settled that village! And{3}Donpa... He is my son...{2}
Now, your grandson, Dodonpa,{3}rules over your village.{2}
Rules? Rules is an ill-{3}sounding word.{2}
But it's an accurate one, Lunpa.{3}Dodonpa is an evil thief, who has{3}caused much trouble in Angara.{2}
What has become of my son?{3}How could he permit such{3}a thing to happen?{2}
Master Lunpa, don't you have any{3}idea how old Donpa is?{2}
He is as I am. An old man...{3}He may be older even than I.{2}
If this news outrages you,{3}why don't you go and set{3}Dodonpa straight?{2}
If only I could...{2}
Is this the only reason we're{3}here? To bring news of the{3}outside world?{30}
You are kind, {17}{5}, but{3}there are much more important{3}matters at hand.{2}
Yes, yes... I am sorry we were{3}sidetracked. We have much{3}more to discuss...{2}
But before we begin, there is{3}one thing I must say...{2}
You don't mind, do{3}you, {17}{5}?{30}
Clearly, your judgment on this{3}matter is fogged, {17}{5}.{3}I must speak.{2}
I knew you'd agree.{2}
I have discussed this with{3}none but {17}{5}, but...I have{3}my own reasons for this quest.{2}
What do you mean?{2}
Only that I have my own{3}reasons for wanting to see{3}the beacons lit again...{2}
Why are you telling us{3}all of this now?{2}
Because I feel this quest{3}is deeply linked to Lemuria.{2}
I thought it odd that Lord Babi{3}should order me to research{3}Alchemy.{2}
Hey, wait a minute... Is this{3}what you promised to tell us{3}once we reached Lemuria?{2}
Yes, yes... May I continue?{2}
Long ago, before Alchemy's{3}power was sealed...{1}There were many civilizations{3}as advanced and cultivated{3}as Lemuria.{2}
At the moment that Alchemy{3}was sealed away, most of those{3}civilizations began to wane...{1}Until eventually, they vanished.{2}
I have formed certain theories{3}now, suggesting that this may{3}be related to the seal on Alchemy.{2}
Let me get this straight...{3}You felt you couldn't tell us{3}this until we were in Lemuria?{2}
And you only wanted to come{3}to Lemuria to test your theories{3}and see if they were true...{2}
But even if everything you{3}said {9}{2}is{7} true, what does{3}it all mean?{2}
If your theories are correct,{3}the world itself will wane and{3}vanish... Won't it, Kraden?{2}
{17}{8} never spoke of{3}this to you, did he?{2}
If you came to this theory{3}on your own, you are indeed{3}a wise scholar.{1}We would do well to trust you.{2}
What do you mean?{2}
King Hydros and I, as well as{3}others in Lemuria, hold the same{3}beliefs that you do, Kraden.{2}
You do!?!{2}
Civilizations thrive by building{3}upon the knowledge of the past.{2}
Knowledge gained in one{3}generation should be taken{3}even further by the next.{1}Thus, knowledge and learning{3}continue to grow. This is the{3}natural course of civilization.{2}
But where is the world today?{2}
The great civilizations of old have{3}all withered and vanished. We{3}are all isolated and alone.{2}
You have encountered many{3}cultures in your travels.{1}Are any of them capable of{3}building the great sanctums{3}and lighthouses you have seen?{2}
No, they are not... But this{3}is not the only sign of the{3}decay you have theorized...{2}
I think it best that you hear{3}the rest directly from His{3}Majesty, King Hydros.{2}
Yes, Kraden! We shall go{3}to visit the king!{2}
Ah, but King Hydros is in{3}counsel with Lord Conservato.{3}We might not be allowed in.{2}
Conservato? That fool. He{3}refuses to acknowledge what{3}he can see with his own eyes!{2}
I will meet with the king and{3}press our evidence upon{3}Conservato. Come with me!{2}
Gah! Stupid door!{2}
{9}{2}HAHHH-AHH!{2}
Pah! At last, you are open!{2}
To the king's chambers!{2}
Lunpa ought to be as old as{3}Lord Babi was, but he has so{3}much energy!{2}
He's got a fire in him.{2}
I do wish I could have heard{3}more about Lord Babi, though.{2}
But come, {17}{5}!{3}To the king's palace we go!{2}
King Hydros awaits you.{3}You are free to enter.{2}
His Highness, the king, has{3}instructed that we let you{3}pass. You are welcome here.{2}
They are clearly using Psynergy,{3}which makes them Adepts...{1}But are they so important that{3}His Highness must make time{3}for them right away?{2}
What does His Highness have{3}in mind? {17}{8}, his{3}friends, and Lunpa are all here.{2}
He is still in chambers with{3}Lord Conservato. Why is he{3}granting them entrance?{2}
If you seek the counsel of His{3}Highness, the king, follow this{3}passage to the doors at the end.{2}
His Highness never leaves a{3}meeting with Conservato in a{3}good mood. Good luck.{2}
Conservato and the king were{3}yelling so loudly that I could{3}hear them from out here.{2}
King Hydros is the wisest of{3}all the Lemurian kings...{1}But I understand why{3}Conservato and his senate{3}oppose the king's plans.{2}
The senate holds King Hydros in{3}poor regard because he favors{3}Lunpa's wisdom over their own.{2}
Lord Conservato holds the{3}most power in Lemuria after{3}the king.{1}I don't think he'll take{3}kindly to the advice of{3}outworlders like these.{2}
Oh, dear! Using Psynergy in the{3}palace of the good King Hydros!?{3}What ill-mannered buffoons!{2}
His Highness, the king, is most{3}temperamental, which is a rare{3}trait in Lemurians.{1}Lord Conservato is calm and{3}collected, like a true Lemurian.{2}
Lord Conservato only raises his{3}voice when he speaks with the{3}king.{1}Their debates frighten me.{3}I can't stand the yelling.{2}
His Highness is worried that{3}Lemuria will wither away.{3}What a ridiculous notion!{2}
I trust the king. If His Majesty{3}is wrong, the fault lies with{3}Lunpa, not with him.{2}
I cannot let the secret of our{3}mystical draught ever reach{3}the outside world.{2}
If the world knew our mystic{3}draughts were nothing but{3}spring water, we'd be overrun!{2}
You are Lord {17}{5}, correct?{30}
Then you have no business here!{3}His Majesty is involved in a most{3}important meeting right now.{2}
It would seem the warriors of{3}which you spoke have arrived.{2}
So it would, Your Highness.{3}I shall call them to us{3}immediately.{2}
There is no need, Lunpa.{3}Let us go to them.{2}
Hydros! Would you see me{3}dishonored thus? They ought{3}to present themselves to us!{2}
I do not go to present myself{3}to them, Conservato. I am{3}merely going to where they are.{1}I have something that I{3}wish to show everyone.{2}
Regardless of your reasons,{3}sire, I will not go to them!{2}
Do as you will, Conservato.{2}
However, {9}{2}we{7} shall go.{2}
I heard of your arrival. It is{3}quite remarkable that you were{3}able to reach Lemuria. Welcome.{2}
Allow me to introduce my{3}companions. This is {17}{7}...{2}
{17}{6}...{2}
{17}{5}...{2}
...And Kraden.{2}
Kraden is the one who told{3}me of the outside world's{3}civilizations, of their condition...{2}
Ah, Kraden! Lunpa describes{3}you as a remarkable scholar.{3}Your research impressed us.{2}
Thank you, Your Highness.{2}
Your theories are correct.{3}Our world is now on a path{3}to destruction.{2}
And who has decided this?{3}You, Hydros?{2}
Some civilizations have{3}vanished, surely, but that is{3}the way of the outside world.{1}Look around you: Lemuria{3}remains unchanged!{2}
Don't delude yourself. Lemuria{3}has been in slow decline for{3}ages now, but that can wait.{2}
My most trusted scholars have{3}reached this conclusion after{3}extensive research.{2}
I sent {17}{8} to confirm{3}this for me...{2}
So you admit it, Hydros!{3}You violated the directive{3}of the senate!{1}You used the tidal wave as{3}your chance to send {17}{8}{3}away, despite our commands!{2}
You are incorrect. The tidal{3}wave carried me away{3}by chance alone.{2}
Conservato, you must know{3}that the tidal wave was caused{3}by Poseidon's return!{2}
Only a fool would have chosen{3}to send a man to sea if he knew{3}that this would have happened.{2}
What was it that you intended{3}to have {17}{8} confirm?{2}
This map shows the ancient world,{3}when Lemuria still traded with{3}people on the many continents.{2}
It was a great age...{3}A time when the world{3}shined brightly.{2}
And this...is the map Lunpa had{3}with him when he arrived in{3}Lemuria 150 years ago...{2}
I used this map to sail around{3}the world. It is quite accurate.{2}
In-Incredible!{2}
You understand, Kraden...{2}
What do you understand?{2}
Well, unless my eyes deceive{3}me, the continents have shrunk{3}since the golden age...{2}
That's insane!{2}
It is not insane! It is true!{2}
Perhaps this will make the{3}point more clearly. Look at{3}these two maps side by side.{2}
There's no mistaking it.{3}The continents on Lunpa's{3}map are clearly smaller...{2}
Lies! Nothing but lies!{2}
What do you hope to gain{3}from foisting these lies{3}upon our people?{2}
You know well that I hope{3}to gain nothing more than{3}the truth, Conservato.{2}
And who do you expect will{3}believe such nonsense?{2}
If you do not believe the{3}evidence before your eyes,{3}what do you believe?{2}
Do you believe the Lemurian{3}map to be accurate to this day?{2}
Tell me, {17}{8}... You were{3}able to investigate this{3}matter, were you not?{2}
Thanks to {17}{5} and my{3}companions, I was able to travel{3}much of the Eastern Sea.{2}
And what did you find?{2}
I found, in truth, that Lunpa's map{3}is the more accurate of the two.{2}
However, the world seems even{3}smaller now than it appears on{3}Lunpa's map...{2}
What are you saying?{2}
Time itself has stopped...{2}
Think of Weyard as a living,{3}breathing being, possessing{3}its own life force...{2}
The four elements are the{3}nourishment needed to sustain{3}this being.{2}
Kraden... This is exactly what{3}King Hydros himself has said{3}to me!{2}
Ever since Alchemy was sealed{3}away, the world has been cut off{3}from its nourishment.{1}It has gone into a state{3}akin to hibernation.{2}
By using less energy, Weyard{3}prolongs its life...{2}
Yet when hibernating, the being{3}has only stopped its own clock...{3}not the flow of time around it.{2}
When a bear sleeps through{3}the winter, it needs only wait{3}for spring to come...{1}When it awakens, it can nourish{3}its weakened body again...{2}
But if spring never comes,{3}the bear will eventually die...{2}
Weyard is wasting away, its{3}continents shrinking, because{3}its spring has never come.{2}
Hydros, how can you make such{3}outrageous claims? The world{3}is not alive...{2}
Tell me, Conservato, why do you{3}think Poseidon has returned?{2}
Do you have the answer, Hydros?{2}
The elemental lighthouses...{2}
{17}{5} and his companions{3}have lit the beacons on both{3}Mercury and Venus Lighthouse.{2}
What!? Have you any idea what{3}will happen if you set that evil{3}loose upon the world again?{30}
You know that it could bring{3}about the destruction of the{3}world, and yet you did it anyway?{2}
When the four beacons are fired,{3}Alchemy will be released, and{3}our world, destroyed.{2}
My lord, you cannot possibly{3}intend for these people to light{3}the remaining beacons!?{2}
I do indeed, Conservato, and I{3}also fear the possibility that{3}Alchemy will destroy the world.{2}
But I cannot stand by, knowing{3}as I do that the world will wither{3}and die if we do not act!{2}
This is madness, Hydros! Does{3}the threat of Alchemy mean{3}so little to you?{1}Would you put the world{3}in even greater danger to{3}satisfy your theories!?{2}
With only two of the beacons{3}lit, I assume you intend to send{3}{17}{8} out again?{2}
And I will go, Lord Conservato.{3}{17}{5} has need of{3}my power!{2}
Then go, {17}{8}...{3}But if you do, say farewell...for{3}you will never be able to return.{1}You will be banished from{3}Lemuria forever.{2}
You know our laws. Are you{3}prepared for the outcome?{2}
I myself am disgusted by{3}the whole matter. I take{3}my leave of you, Hydros.{2}
But I warn you... I will {9}{2}not{7}{3}permit you to go through{3}with this madness!{2}
What will you do, Your Highness?{2}
I knew this outcome was{3}inevitable.{2}
But I could not sit silent while{3}our world drifted down the{3}path of its destruction.{2}
I want you to light the{3}remaining beacons before{3}you return.{2}
That's what we intend to do,{3}but we cannot leave the{3}Eastern Sea...{2}
I have already heard of{3}this problem from {17}{8}...{2}
This is something I found{3}by accident in some ruins{3}back in my days as a thief.{2}
I'm not sure what it is,{3}but it seems to contain{3}some powerful Psynergy.{2}
Seems to? You are{3}not certain?{2}
It is a Psynergy that we{3}Lemurians are unable to use.{2}
I understand you travel with{3}many different kinds of Adepts,{3}do you not, {17}{5}?{2}
If we include {17}{8} in our{3}numbers, we have one Adept{3}for each of the four elements.{2}
Then at least one of you should{3}be able to use the Psynergy{3}that this contains.{2}
King Hydros believes the item{3}can only be used by one who{3}wields Psynergy of the earth.{2}
If I am not mistaken, it{3}is a powerful Psynergy{3}we call Grind.{2}
If you master this Psynergy,{3}the reefs that block your way{3}shall pose no trouble anymore...{2}
With Grind, you should be able{3}to create a path by which you{3}can sail into the Western Sea.{2}
Go, brave Adepts! By your hands,{3}may the remaining lighthouses{3}burn bright once more!{2}
That Psynergy is quite{3}powerful. It can only be{3}trusted to a very few people.{2}
That His Highness has given{3}it to you should illustrate how{3}great his expectations are.{2}
I have no doubt that your journey{3}will be fraught with ever-{3}increasing danger...{1}But we are counting on{3}you, {17}{5}.{2}
I've never seen Lord Conservato{3}so angry before...{2}
Lord Conservato has ordered{3}us to prevent you from leaving{3}the island...{1}But I cannot see why he would{3}do something like that.{2}
I'm sure the senate has{3}something to say about this.{3}What's going on around here?{2}
How could Lord Conservato{3}expect someone like me to{3}believe that King Hydros...{1}Would order {17}{8} to{3}destroy the world?{2}
Lord Conservato seemed very{3}angry. Maybe that's why he{3}called for a senate meeting.{2}
Both Lord Conservato and the{3}king want peace for us, so why{3}must they fight all the time?{2}
Maybe once you have left,{3}the king and Conservato{3}will come to an accord.{2}
Today, His Highness and Lord{3}Conservato were arguing more{3}loudly than ever before!{2}
If Hydros plans to unleash{3}Alchemy upon the world{3}again, then I am against it.{2}
If you and Lunpa were all to{3}leave Lemuria, I think we'd have{3}peace and quiet here again.{2}
The senate's reports usually{3}tend to influence the popular{3}opinion in Lemuria.{1}I'll bet that is a constant{3}annoyance to the king...{2}
The king's leadership is too{3}progressive... It's as though he{3}invites opposition.{1}Of course he doesn't get along{3}with the senate. It's their duty{3}to protect the laws of old!{2}
Whenever outsiders arrive{3}in Lemuria, it means trouble.{1}{17}{8} has done{3}nothing but stir up trouble{3}by bringing them here.{2}
What will happen to us? Will{3}Lord Conservato be able to{3}stop the king's plans?{2}
As long as I can live in peace,{3}I am happy. I suppose that is a{3}sign of growing old...{2}
I know why Lemuria ended{3}all its dealings with the{3}outside world...{1}Lemurians want peace.{3}We desire no change.{2}
Do not listen to Conservato.{3}We cannot let the world{3}wither and die.{1}Go, brave Adepts! By your hands,{3}may the remaining lighthouses{3}burn bright once more!{2}
You must sail to the Western Sea.{3}Do not worry about Lemuria.{3}Ignite the elemental beacons.{1}Conservato lacks the conviction{3}to discuss these matters with{3}the people of Lemuria.{2}
I think I overheard something{3}I shouldn't have... I'll forget{3}everything.{2}
My people may not desire{3}change, but I cannot let that{3}stop me.{1}I do this not for myself, but{3}for all those yet to be born{3}throughout Weyard.{2}
His Majesty has come to this{3}decision on his own, without{3}the counsel of his advisors.{1}This is why I must remain{3}by his side and support his{3}decision.{2}
The actions of King Hydros{3}are treasonous. They betray{3}the will of his people.{2}
The door is locked... It sounds{3}as if there's a raucous caucus{3}going on inside...{2}
Umm... {17}{8}?{30}
Yes, {17}{7}? What is it?{30}
There's something I've{5}{3}been meaning to ask you...{3}Something I{5} have to ask you...{30}
Ask me, {17}{7}.{30}
You and I look roughly{3}the same age, but {5}how{3}old are you, really?{30}
Is that your question,{3}{17}{7}? It's not important!{30}
It is to me. If you are much older{3}than us, then I'm afraid we've not{3}shown you the proper respect.{30}
She's got a point.{30}
Don't worry about such things.{3}Please, treat me as you have{3}all along.{30}
No, that won't do.{3}You have to tell us.{30}
What!? Come now!{3}This is silly!{30}
No, {17}{8}! Tell me!{30}
You're afraid you haven't shown{3}me the proper respect, and yet{3}you make demands of me?{30}
Come on, {17}{8}...{3}You can tell us.{3}How old are you really?{30}
This has nothing to do with{3}respect! You just want to know{3}how old I am, don't you!{30}
Hee hee!{30}
Heh heh!{30}
Oh ho ho ho!!!{30}
I knew it! Come on,{3}{17}{5}! Can't you get{3}them off my back?{30}
... ...{30}
You're in this too, aren't you,{3}{17}{5}? I've had it with your{3}conspiracies! I will not tell you!{30}
Oh!{2}
Goodness!{2}
{17}{5}! Look over here!{3}This palace is magnificient!{2}
Where are you going, {17}{5}?{3}Let's take a longer look around!{2}
{17}{5}, are we setting{3}off now?{30}
Then, to sea we go!{2}
Please don't rush on my{3}account. Let's enjoy our stay.{2}
What's the matter?{3}Can't you climb up?{3}...Fine. Just a moment.{2}
You came all this way and{3}then got stuck here? You{3}can't be very bright.{2}
There! Is that better?{3}Now climb up here.{2}
Drinking from this spring{3}restores vigor and vitality!{3}Want a sip?{2}
These turtles have lived in{3}the spring forever... It must be{3}the water that does it...{2}
{17}{5} and the others{3}drank of the spring.{1}Their HP and PP were{3}fully replenished!{2}
{17}{5} read the sign:{1}The Spring of Lemuria{3}Face away and toss in a{3}coin to test your luck.{2}
{17}{5} read the sign:{1}The Spring of Lemuria{3}Toss in a Lucky Medal{3}to improve your luck.{2}
If you face away from the spring,{3}toss in a coin, and land it in the{3}target, good fortune will come.{1}You've traveled a long way{3}to be here. You should give{3}it a try.{2}
I'd love to test my luck, but{3}I've used up all my coins. Maybe{3}I'll take one out of the spring!{2}
I remember an outsider who came{3}to Lemuria and then spent {9}{2}days{7}{3}testing his luck at the spring!{2}
He had such a good time, he{3}said he was going to build a{3}spring like this in his hometown.{2}
Do you wish to test your luck{3}at the Spring of Lemuria?{30}
Well, then, I'll just take{3}a turn...{1}If you change your mind,{3}let me know, and I will give{3}you a chance.{2}
Go ahead.{3}Test your luck!{2}
You look like you're in for{3}a spell of good luck.{1}After all, your aura glows{3}brightly about you!{2}
No one is luckier than him{3}who believes in his luck and{3}has friends who believe in him.{2}
Don't tell me, you're here to{3}solve the riddle of the rock!{30}
I don't want to scare you but,{3}I think you should reconsider.{1}Even the warriors who survive{3}to make it back do so by the{3}skin of their teeth.{2}
Just passing through? Here's{3}some advice for you:{3}Steer clear of the mountain.{1}I don't know what kind of{3}treasure's up there, but it's{3}not worth your life.{2}
I hear Kibombo has finally{3}chosen a new witch doctor.{1}Maybe now, they'll calm down{3}and not be so aggressive...{2}
There was a giant explosion{3}on the rock the other night...{3}I couldn't get back to sleep at all.{2}
The mountain is called Magma{3}Rock, and it's cursed... No one's{3}supposed to go up there.{2}
We're lucky the river floods{3}over every season. That's what{3}keeps the Kibombo away.{1}We were fine this year, though.{3}They still hadn't chosen a new{3}witch doctor, so they stayed put.{2}
The explosions within Magma{3}Rock are called magma balls.{1}They're formed naturally{3}near the mouth of the{3}volcano. Scary, huh?{2}
You must be very brave to{3}come all the way here by boat.{2}
There's a place called Shaman{3}Village in the middle of{3}the continent.{1}Supposedly, one of the rivers{3}leads to it. I have no idea{3}which one, though.{2}
The people of Shaman Village{3}are very wary of strangers. Be{3}careful if you ever meet them.{2}
For a continent as desolate{3}as this one, there sure have{3}been a lot of boats here lately.{2}
I think there's a cave down{3}at the end of the river. That's{3}the way into Shaman Village.{1}I wonder if I should tell them{3}what the legends say... Nah,{3}they look like a smart group.{2}
Long ago, Shaman was{3}ravaged by outsiders.{3}It was terrible.{1}From that day on, they simply{3}have not trusted strangers{3}in their village.{2}
If you want to cross the glaciers{3}of the Northern Sea, you'll need{3}magma balls...{1}They come from volcanoes, but{3}the best place to get them is{3}Magma Rock, to the south.{2}
A long time ago, we used to{3}trade with a village named Prox{3}to the north of us.{1}But the sea freezes in winter,{3}and over time, it just became{3}impossible to get there.{2}
The people of Loho have a{3}legendary weapon called a{3}cannon that fires magma balls.{1}That's supposed to be how{3}they crossed the frozen wastes,{3}but it sounds like a tall tale.{2}
The Northern Sea is thick with{3}icebergs in the winter. They{3}can sink a boat in an instant!{2}
There's nothing to the west of{3}here. AND it's really dangerous.{3}You shouldn't go that way.{2}
The sea west of here spills{3}over a massive waterfall.{1}You'll really start to appreciate{3}the grandeur of nature if you{3}see that, I can tell you.{2}
The currents are so strong{3}near the falls that any boat{3}caught in it is doomed.{2}
My buddy thinks I'm nuts{3}to risk my life for a look{3}at the falls.{1}Actually, I just want to get{3}my hands on some treasure{3}I saw on the way there.{2}
We've made these wings and{3}carried them here just to{3}fulfill a great prophecy.{2}
We must be prepared to{3}attach these wings to{3}the sacred vessel.{1}It is said that we will know{3}the time has come when{3}Mt. Jupiter is in flames.{2}
We brought these wings from{3}Contigo, and now we're guarding{3}them.{1}If they were damaged or{3}broken, the prophecy might{3}never be fulfilled.{2}
I wonder if these giant wings{3}will really make it fly... I'd{3}like to see that.{2}
We first heard the prophecy{3}three years ago... The wings{3}have come a long way since then.{2}
These wings are so heavy{3}that they would sink an{3}ordinary ship.{1}I wonder what kind of ship{3}the sacred vessel is.{2}
I doubt anyone could hurt{3}these sturdy wings, but we{3}must guard them just the same.{2}
It's kind of hard to imagine{3}what these wings would look{3}like actually flapping.{2}
There's something burning{3}like an ember within the stone.{2}
Do you want to retrieve it?{30}
{17}{5} got{3}a Magma Ball.{2}
{17}{5} checked the tablet...{3}There's something etched on it.{1}Wielder of Flame's strength,{3}Lay your hands upon this stone.{1}If th'art worthy, I will grant thee{3}the power to Blaze with fire.{2}
Flame's strength? Hey, that must{3}mean it's finally my turn!{2}
{17}{6} touched the tablet.{2}
{17}{6} received the{3}fire Psynergy Blaze.{2}
Do you know anything about a{3}legend about these people who{3}could control the wind and air?{30}
Well, the legend says that these{3}giants from Anemos built{3}Contigo with their wind powers.{2}
That was the Anemos tribe.{3}They even had the power to{3}fly through the air!{1}The people of Contigo inherited{3}some of their power, and now,{3}we rule over Atteka.{2}
The beacon within Jupiter{3}Lighthouse will soon be lit.{1}I know this because of a{3}strange premonition I had{3}three years ago.{2}
I guess the people of Contigo{3}lost the power they inherited{3}from the Anemos tribe.{2}
The people of Anemos possessed{3}power over the wind. They could{3}also see into the future.{2}
When the power of Anemos is{3}lost, a group will come to light{3}the beacon against darkness.{1}We had thought it was{3}nothing but legend, but{3}it is all coming true.{2}
The Anemos geoglyphs show a{3}boat with wings sprouting from{3}its hull...{1}The story goes that these{3}wings could make the boat{3}float in the air...{2}
If you want to get a look at{3}the Anemos geoglyphs, you{3}ought to go to the ruins...{2}
Our people have labored{3}for some time to build{3}the Wings of the Anemos.{2}
The Anemos blood in our{3}veins often brings about{3}strange miracles.{2}
Surely, someone will come{3}soon to light the beacon{3}atop the lighthouse.{2}
The power of the wind is{3}not all that we've lost.{1}We have lost much of{3}our culture, as well as the{3}technology to rebuild the ruins.{2}
There were two siblings born in{3}Contigo. The older held great{3}power. Both are gone now...{1}The younger was only a baby{3}when he left the village. I don't{3}know how strong he became.{2}
I think Jupiter Lighthouse will{3}be lit soon. I don't know when,{3}but it will happen soon.{2}
It's hard to believe, but the{3}Anemos really did have the{3}power to make ships fly.{2}
The Anemos geoglyphs are{3}the most amazing carvings{3}I've ever seen...{2}
We built the Wings of Anemos{3}out of materials we found in{3}the ruins of Anemos Sanctum.{2}
The siblings who inherited the{3}powers of the Anemos aren't{3}in Contigo anymore.{1}The younger brother was just{3}a baby when the merchant{3}known as Hammet took him away.{2}
I'm sure the younger brother,{3}{17}{3}, must be grown up{3}by now... Is he still with Hammet?{2}
My father doesn't approve of{3}the way I look up to Yegelos.{2}
The families of children who{3}inherited those powers lived{3}lives of constant suffering.{1}Eventually, they left Contigo to{3}make their fortunes elsewhere.{2}
{17}{3}'s mother left him in{3}the care of a kindly merchant.{3}She died shortly afterward.{1}I think she died of sorrow at{3}sending {17}{3} away. She{3}wanted a better life for him.{2}
I wish I could have inherited{3}the power of the Anemos.{3}Then I could be a hero.{2}
Long ago, the people of{3}Hesperia attacked Atteka. Our{3}forefathers were not afraid.{1}With the help of the great hero{3}Yegelos, we drove them off, and{3}they haven't invaded since.{2}
A long time ago, the tribes{3}of Shaman and Contigo were{3}at constant war.{1}Throughout their many battles,{3}the warriors Yegelos and{3}Hoabna formed a friendship.{2}
For a long time now, Contigo{3}has been without a hero. This{3}depresses our youth, I think.{2}
Everybody thinks the people{3}of Contigo are strong, but{3}we just hate to fight.{1}It's strange, because Yegelos{3}loved to fight, and Hoabna{3}was the stronger of the two.{2}
Soon, the siblings with the{3}power of the Anemos will{3}return and fulfill the legend.{2}
The power of the Anemos is{3}all but gone in Contigo.{1}However, it sometimes happens{3}that a newborn suddenly{3}shows power over the wind.{2}
I don't have any powers like{3}the Anemos did, but my sister,{3}Ahri, is different.{2}
The baby's forehead is{3}furrowed, like it's thinking.{2}
Babu bawaba bibaw.{2}
It sure is drafty in this{3}shabby old house.{2}
When the Wings of Anemos are{3}complete, let's fix the house!{2}
I just know {17}{3} became{3}big and manly, just like{3}Yegelos. I know he'll return...{2}
A terrible misfortune fell on{3}the family of the siblings...{3}It's a terrible story.{2}
Whenever my sister furrows{3}her brow like that, strange{3}things happen around here.{2}
Bawaba... It's hot...{3}I want cool wind, babu baba.{2}
It was a longstanding tradition{3}that people in Atteka would take{3}a pilgrimage to Anemos Sanctum.{1}Since we began construction{3}on the wings, everyone is{3}coming to Contigo to help.{2}
Of course, they're here to work,{3}not to fight, so business is{3}still in the pits.{2}
Mining materials in the ruins{3}is dangerous work, so my{3}armor is selling well.{2}
Nothing else around here is{3}selling well, but at least I'm{3}pulling through all right.{2}
The villagers are working their{3}hardest to complete the wings{3}and fulfill the prophecy.{2}
Oh, how I want to see the{3}sunlight shining off these{3}wings up in the sky!{2}
We've had so many people{3}coming to Contigo lately{3}that we're full, and I'm beat!{2}
All the work on the wings{3}means that our inn is always{3}full! It's a good time for us!{2}
Gotta make all the beds{3}before everyone returns{3}from Anemos Sanctum...{1}Then, I've gotta get started{3}setting things up for dinner{3}before they come down to eat!{2}
If I don't make dinner now,{3}it won't be ready in time for{3}all our guests to eat!{2}
Did you just arrive in Contigo?{1}Are you connected to the{3}prophecy, or are you here to{3}help build the wings?{2}
The prophecies of the Anemos{3}tell that someday soon, a true{3}miracle will occur...{2}
I worked myself half to death{3}yesterday. I feel miserable, but{3}I'll do it again tomorrow.{2}
The Wings of Anemos are{3}nearly complete... I think I'll{3}take tomorrow off.{2}
I'm afraid I'm too old to help in{3}the construction of the wings,{3}but I so want to see them fly...{2}
When is that miracle of the{3}Anemos gonna hurry up and{3}happen? I can't wait forever!{2}
I threw my back out helping with{3}the wings. I can't touch my toes.{3}I can barely touch my knees.{2}
I want to see the boat{3}when it sails through the{3}air on our wings.{1}But even more, I want to see{3}the hero of prophecy... Will he{3}be a real looker, like Yegelos?{2}
The real miracle will be if{3}these wings actually make{3}a boat fly.{1}However, I remain open-minded.{3}I hope we can see this miracle{3}of Anemos soon!{2}
If I see the Wings of Anemos{3}make a boat fly through the{3}air, I too shall be a believer.{2}
I've come a long way to{3}see the flying boat. I hope{3}the prophecies are right.{2}
The wings are almost done.{3}We just need to get them to{3}the bay and await the ship.{2}
The wings will be finished{3}shortly. Where is the ship{3}they're going to be attached to?{2}
Which part goes where? Does{3}this metal feather connect{3}to that wooden post?{1}It's like a puzzle, and it's{3}getting rather complicated.{2}
You've gotta watch out, 'cause{3}you don't want to break{3}anything... It's delicate work!{2}
Just a few more touches, and{3}the wings are done. All we have{3}left is to assemble them!{2}
The guys carrying the other wing{3}haven't come back, and we're{3}almost ready to send this one!{2}
I've been really busy lately,{3}but now that the second wing{3}is almost done, I can rest.{2}
What do we do if we made{3}these wings, and then no boat{3}shows up for us to put them on?{2}
There are too many parts!{3}I think I'm going insane from{3}all these stupid parts!{2}
When I start getting irritated,{3}I just go nuts. I think I should{3}avoid getting irritated.{2}
How long have we been{3}working on these stupid{3}wings?{1}When I see that boat{3}soaring through the{3}skies, I think I'll cry.{2}
Have you taken a good look{3}at the Anemos geoglyph?{30}
You can't see all of it right{3}now, because the wings are{3}covering up the picture...{2}
Oh, that's really too bad.{3}The picture of the flying{3}boat looks so cool.{2}
That sign has a translation of{3}the characters on the wall.{1}If you're interested in studying{3}the sanctum, you should give it{3}a read.{2}
I want to get a good look at{3}the inside of the sanctum, but{3}I can't get this door open.{1}I'm hoping that deciphering{3}these characters on the wall{3}might give me the clue I need.{2}
The merchant Hammet took{3}the gold in this room with{3}him when he left Contigo.{1}He vowed to use the money{3}to raise {17}{3} properly{3}and give him a good life.{2}
I can't even imagine how cool{3}it would be to see a boat like{3}the one in the geoglyph.{1}But it's so big! I doubt{3}there's a boat that big{3}anywhere!{2}
I don't know if anyone{3}in Contigo cares about{3}what I'm doing here.{1}But I know that devoted{3}pilgrims will appreciate{3}having this translation.{2}
Wouldn't that be terrible if{3}I got the door open and there{3}was nothing on the other side?{2}
Someone told me that Hammet{3}went to a town called Kalay{3}and did quite well for himself.{2}
{17}{5} examined the wall.{3}There are characters carved{3}into it.{1}Hmmm... I keep staring at it,{3}but it's not making any{3}more sense.{2}
{17}{5} examined the sign.{3}The characters from the wall{3}are translated there.{1}Some them are gates, and{3}some them are roads.{1}Search with your heart to{3}find the truest path.{2} 
Turn the slot and get a prize!{3}The lottery slots are over here.{2}
Drop some cash and double up!{3}The hi-lo dice are over here!{2}
You never know what the{3}dice will do next! Come and{3}give our dice a toss!{2}
It's good to have this much{3}business, but what happens to{3}us when the wings are done?{2}
Once the wings are finished,{3}all these guests will leave.{3}Until then, I'll work my hardest.{2}
I've got so much to do that{3}I don't even have time to{3}eat! I'm starving!!!{2}
I must be the greatest chef in{3}the world! Look at all this food{3}I've been making! I'm amazing!{2}
... ...{2}
Hm. Outsiders... I don't like{3}the looks of them. I'm just{3}going to wait until they leave.{2}
Until the chief says otherwise,{3}nobody will talk to these{3}outsiders. It's the law.{2}
Who invited these foreigners{3}into our town?{2}
Ugh... Foreigners. I'm not{3}going to waste my time{3}even {9}{2}talking{7} to them!{2}
Our ancestors learned a harsh{3}lesson... Shamans never lie, but{3}outsiders are never honest.{2}
Our ancestors learned that we{3}can trust no one but the people{3}of Contigo, our longtime friends.{2}
These foreigners look{3}trustworthy, but I know{3}better...{1}They may seem nice, but all{3}outsiders are wicked!{2}
Shut your doors tight{3}when outsiders are in sight.{1}If we want to protect ourselves,{3}our culture, we have to keep{3}outsiders {9}{2}out{7}.{2}
It seems to be locked.{2}
Trial Road{3}None may enter without{3}permission from Moapa.{2}
The entrance is closed.{3}You probably shouldn't go in.{2}
This is my house. If you're{3}looking for Moapa, here I am.{3}Back up. Give me some room.{2}
Who have we here? Strangers{3}in Shaman Village? What is your{3}purpose in coming here?{2}
Shaman Village does not{3}appreciate intruders.{2}
You're not welcome here,{3}outlander. Leave now, and{3}never come back.{2}
If there's something you want{3}to say, hurry up and say it.{3}I'll listen, but not for long!{2}
What's wrong? Nothing to say?{3}Then what are you standing{3}around for? Get out of town!{2}
If there's something you want{3}to say, say it to Moapa, not{3}to us. We don't want to hear it.{2}
If you anger Moapa, you'll be{3}in for a little taste of his{3}awesome and terrible power.{2}
They don't look like they've{3}come from Contigo... There's{3}no reason for us to be nice.{2}
If it hadn't been for Moapa,{3}I'd have been glad to fling{3}these outlanders into the cold.{2}
Maybe they're looking for{3}treasure. They ought to be{3}looking in Contigo, not here.{1}The temple near Contigo is{3}filled with treasures beyond{3}belief.{2}
If you're here offering charity,{3}I won't have it... Or did you{3}want to show me something?{2}
What makes you think I would{3}be interested in this?{1}Show it to Moapa if you{3}must, but I don't need it.{2}
Yes, yes. That's very nice.{3}Did you want to sell it? Because{3}I don't have any money.{2}
That's the Shaman's Rod!{2}
We thought it was lost{3}forever... It once belonged{3}to the great Hoabna.{2}
Hoabna's staff was a gift from{3}his great friend in Contigo,{3}Yegelos.{1}When Yegelos gave it to him,{3}Hoabna accepted a great{3}responsibility...{2}
He vowed to care for the sacred{3}treasure of Contigo, the Hover{3}Jade...{1}When the Shaman's Rod returns{3}to us, we are charged to give{3}the bearer the Hover Jade.{2}
Have you outlanders come{3}to claim the Hover Jade?{2}
I suppose we have, yes.{2}
That's a shame. We'll never{3}give the Hover Jade to you!{2}
But...we brought you the{3}Shaman's Rod... What's stopping{3}you from giving us the jade?{2}
Hoabna handed the Hover{3}Jade down from generation to{3}generation for our care.{2}
We are to return it to the{3}descendants of Yegelos. And{3}you are clearly not from Contigo.{2}
That's preposterous! We{3}returned your rod! We've come{3}so far already!{2}
What difference does it make{3}if we're from Contigo or not!?{2}
Make no mistake about it. We{3}are the intended recipients of{3}the stone of Yegelos.{2}
Is there some way we can get{3}our hands on the Hover Jade?{2}
No. You ask the impossible.{2}
What about...the test? Would{3}that be a bad idea, Moapa?{2}
You know, Trial Road? Only{3}Yegelos could walk that path.{2}
The way of the vanishing sand!{2}
Yes, if you outlanders intend{3}to claim the Hover Jade, you{3}must fetch it and bring it here!{2}
If you people have the{3}courage, follow me! {2}
If you'd told us there was a{3}test to begin with, we'd have{3}been out of your hair by now.{2}
What kind of test is this?{2}
I understand that you're a{3}little concerned, but unless{3}you try it, you'll never know!{2}
Give it your best, {17}{5}!{2}
Moapa left the door open, and{3}strangers got in... Ah, but they're{3}gone already...{2}
The outlanders look like{3}warriors, but they're nothing{3}next to my father.{1}He's the leader of Shaman{3}Village, but he's also just so{3}strong! He never loses!{2}
Those are the first foreigners{3}I've ever seen... They don't look{3}so different from us.{2}
The card reads "Put {22} coins{3}on the counter, and you can stay."{1}Will you pay {22} coins?{30}
I don't much like strangers,{3}but if they're willing to pay,{3}I'm willing to let them stay.{2}
Moapa ordered us to let them{3}stay. I don't know why, though.{3}It's not like we lock the doors.{2}
There's something written on{3}the card: "If you don't have any{3}money, feel free to leave. Now."{2}
Nothing personal, but nobody in{3}town will talk to you.{1}It may seem weird, but it's{3}a law among the Shaman{3}tribe.{2}
They'll need to find Moapa{3}if they want to talk to one{3}of the locals.{2}
To inherit the stone of Yegelos,{3}you must cause this sand{3}to disappear.{1}If you can manage that feat,{3}then the blood of Contigo{3}runs through your veins.{2}
Just ahead lies Trial Road,{3}where Hoabna and Yegelos{3}fought their greatest battles.{1}Only superior ones such as{3}they could have followed{3}the road to its end.{2}
When Yegelos and Hoabna{3}waged their mighty battles here,{3}the sand suddenly vanished.{2}
I know the truth. These{3}outlanders stole the rod{3}from Contigo.{1}No matter. Their misdeeds{3}will be revealed to all when{3}they fail the Trial Road.{2}
If they lack the power of Contigo{3}or the power of Shaman Village,{3}they will fail.{2}
They stand no chance of{3}making the sand vanish. They{3}will give up and go home.{2}
You can do it, {17}{7}!{2}
Leave it to me, {17}{6}.{3}This will be a breeze.{2}
I don't believe it. They did{3}it! The sand vanished!{2}
The legends... They were{3}all true!{2}
She's the one! She must{3}have come from Contigo!{2}
Her?{2}
She's the one that did it?{3}But she's...just a girl!{2}
Well, you wanted the sand{3}to vanish, so...{2}
Can we have the Hover{3}Jade now?{2}
Nope, you still can't have it.{2}
What? Why not?{2}
This was just a test to see{3}if you earned the right to{3}take the test to earn the stone.{2}
So, there's more that they{3}have to do before you'll give{3}them the stone?{2}
You will have to reach{3}the end of Trial Road.{2}
The girls, too? Surely you{3}can't make them...{2}
I thought that only the chosen{3}hero could travel the road...{2}
What, are you saying I can't{3}be the chosen hero?{2}
The heroes have always been{3}men, ever since the time of{3}Hoabna. It is the way.{2}
I don't like your attitude,{3}mister! I can be every bit{3}as heroic as some guy!{2}
That may be true, but you{3}must respect our customs.{2}
It's the same in Contigo,{3}you know. If you don't like{3}it, take it up with Yegelos.{2}
Hold it, hold it... Moapa,{3}what were you just saying{3}about Trial Road?{2}
If we reach the end of Trial{3}Road, won't our names join{3}the ranks of your heroes?{2}
Kraden's right... It shouldn't{3}matter if a girl does it... All{3}that matters is that we finish!{2}
If you give us the chance,{3}we will prove it to you.{2}
Unless you're afraid that a{3}girl like me might become{3}your town's newest hero.{2}
Have they earned the right?{3}Shall we let them onto Trial Road?{2}
I don't like the way these{3}outsiders were talking to me.{2}
I think they need to learn{3}exactly what it takes to be{3}a hero around here!{2}
Yeah, if these guys are so{3}stubborn, let's give them a{3}shot! They'll probably give up!{2}
You said it yourselves. We're{3}too stubborn to quit.{2}
Yeah. If you want us "outlanders"{3}to leave, you'd better give us{3}a chance to walk Trial Road!{2}
Trial Road is a difficult one...{3}When you reach the top, a{3}terrible battle awaits you.{2}
It's difficult enough for me. I{3}expect you will find it quite{3}impossible. Still interested?{30}
You seem confident, but it{3}is your ignorance speaking.{2}
So... You are not as sure of{3}yourselves as you first seemed.{2}
But I will permit this. Follow{3}me, and I shall explain.{2}
Listen carefully to me.{2}
This cave provides you with{3}an opportunity to practice{3}your skills.{2}
Legends say that Yegelos and{3}Hoabna once fought here. These{3}columns commemorate this.{2}
They raced one another{3}to the summit...{2}
And there, they fought with{3}all their might on the peak{3}of the mountain.{2}
In honor of their great{3}battle, the leaders of{3}Shaman created this trial.{2}
The rules are simple.{2}
The room is filled with traps{3}and snares. Use the power of{3}Contigo to avoid them.{2}
This road has four doors. To{3}open them, you will need to{3}place items in these chests. {2}
Why?{2}
The door is triggered only when{3}the treasure chests are filled{3}to the correct weight.{2}
Try putting heavier items, like{3}weapons and tools, into the{3}chests, or the doors won't open.{2}
If you reach the door after{3}your opponents do, you will{3}be at a serious disadvantage.{2}
You see, it will take twice the{3}weight to open the doors.{2}
Stand on the switch, and the{3}number of chests you need{3}to fill will open.{2}
If you are last to each of{3}the four doors, you will lose{3}eight items to the chests!{2}
If Trial Road proves too much{3}for you, press this button.{2}
This ends the battle, though.{3}A true hero would not{3}surrender so easily.{2}
In order to reach the battle{3}at the summit, you cannot{3}fail on Trial Road.{2}
Do you understand?{30}
Would you like me to{3}explain it to you again?{30}
Do all outlanders share{3}your thickwittedness?{2}
Then you understand the{3}treacherous path of Trial{3}Road. Will you continue?{30}
You have chosen wisely,{3}and for your wisdom, you{3}must leave Shaman Village.{2}
You have heard the rules,{3}and you wish to continue.{3}You have been warned.{2}
But what's this? You no{3}longer have the Shaman's Rod?{1}We cannot accept your{3}challenge if you do not have{3}the Shaman's Rod. Leave me.{2}
It looks as though you are{3}missing the item you need{3}if you are to challenge us.{1}Without it, we won't even{3}entertain the idea of competing{3}with you. Leave us at once.{2}
Choose the road of your{3}liking. It matters not to us.{2}
Choose the road of your{3}liking. It matters not to us.{2}
Do you need to hear Moapa's{3}explanation again?{30}
Thick-witted outsiders.{2}
Then you must leave{3}Shaman Village and forget{3}about the Hover Jade.{2}
Do you need to hear Moapa's{3}explanation again?{30}
Thick-witted outsiders.{2}
As long as you remain in{3}our village, my people are{3}not free to do as they will.{1}If you are not going to take{3}the challenge of Trial Road,{3}you must leave Shaman Village.{2}
I cannot lose. I will not{3}lose.{1}It is my responsibility as{3}head of the Shaman tribe.{2}
You're doomed. Moapa is{3}the greatest warrior in all{3}of Hesperia.{2}
You don't seem like bad{3}people, for outlanders, but{3}we cannot give you the jade.{1}Only the hero with the blood{3}of Yegelos, the hero of Contigo,{3}can claim the gem.{2}
Have you decided to give up{3}this foolishness once and for all?{30}
You have chosen wisely,{3}and for your wisdom, you{3}must leave Shaman Village.{2}
Choose the road of your{3}liking. It matters not to us.{2}
If you have chosen, then we{3}shall take the other path.{2}
On the count of three,{3}the challenge begins!{2}
Do you want to challenge{3}me on Trial Road?{30}
You have chosen wisely,{3}and for your wisdom, you{3}must leave Shaman Village.{2}
Do you need to hear Moapa's{3}explanation again?{30}
Thick-witted outsiders.{2}
Let's get on with it, then.{2}
Place this item in the chest?{30}
The chest won't open. There's{3}something keeping it shut tight.{2}
{16} put {18}{1}'s{3}{20}{1} in the chest.{2}
Do you want to give up?{30}
Yes
No
It would be wise of you to{3}quit. Even if you reach the{3}top, you cannot beat me.{1}You would do well to leave{3}Shaman Village at once.{2}
You may have been slow, but{3}you made it through Trial{3}Road to the mountain's peak!{2}
Well, then... The time is nigh for{3}us to decide who is stronger!{2}
Let the battle begin!{2}
You were quite swift! You{3}may prove a challenge yet!{2}
However, just because you're{3}fast doesn't mean you're strong.{3}Challenge or no, I will win.{2}
Let the battle begin!{2}
You've lost. Now leave{3}Shaman village.{2}
All right, all right. You've{3}proven your strength, and{3}you are heroes indeed.{2}
As we promised, you will{3}receive the Hover Jade, and{3}we will take the Shaman's Rod.{2}
After many years, the vow that{3}Hoabna made to Yegelos has{3}at last been fulfilled!{2}
I'm tired now. I'll be back in{3}the Shaman Village resting.{2}
I'm sure you must be exhausted{3}as well. Let's go back to the{3}village and rest.{2}
So, you rose to the challenge{3}of Trial Road? Moapa was{3}quite impressed with you!{2}
The people of Shaman Village{3}are normally quiet, valiant, and{3}noble.{1}You defeated Moapa, and we{3}must respect the bravery you{3}demonstrated in fighting him.{2}
You defeated Moapa, and{3}that is ample proof of your{3}skill as warriors.{1}I think you will find that the{3}people of Shaman Village{3}treat you quite differently now.{2}
Heroes cannot be evil. And{3}now, we have learned that{3}heroes can be foreigners, too.{2}
Your battle with Moapa was{3}just like the legendary battle{3}between Hoabna and Yegelos!{1}I would love to have watched,{3}to see a new legend in the{3}making...{2}
Everyone in town is talking{3}about how you have fulfilled{3}Hoabna's promise.{2}
After your battle, did you{3}check on the other side{3}of the mountain?{30}
Did you see the spring? There's{3}supposed to be a spring that{3}only Hoabna could find.{2}
If you have the same powers{3}Hoabna had, you might be able{3}to get there...{1}Nobody with the powers of{3}the Shaman tribe alone can{3}reach the hidden spring.{2}
Some people among the{3}Shaman tribe possess{3}a special power...{1}The story goes that those{3}with this power are the{3}chosen few.{2}
Moapa is quite honorable to{3}sing their praises. This is{3}what makes him a leader.{2}
It's tough to imagine this{3}bunch beating Moapa, but{3}I'm not thinking about it.{2}
Someday, a child in Shaman{3}will grow to be stronger{3}even than Moapa.{1}Then, the Shaman tribe will{3}rise up again and reclaim{3}what it once lost to Contigo.{2}
We are too cautious around{3}strangers. The world should{3}not be such an unfriendly place.{2}
I never thought I'd live{3}to see the day Hoabna's{3}promise was fulfilled.{1}Of course, I never thought{3}anyone with Contigo blood{3}could defeat a Shaman hero.{2}
I hope that we remain{3}close friends with the{3}Contigo after this.{2}
If I had the power to break{3}down walls of sand, I'd climb to{3}the other side of the mountain.{2}
People living on the outskirts{3}of Shaman Village have different{3}powers from us.{1}Why would that be?{2}
I can finally open the door{3}and air the place out.{1}I can't believe Moapa was{3}on the mountain fighting while{3}I was stuck in here.{2}
If I'd known that there was{3}going to be a challenge{3}on Trial Road...{1}I wouldn't have locked up.{3}I'd have been right up there,{3}watching the fight!{2}
I thought it was quiet out here.{3}I've been locked inside all{3}day, so I couldn't check...{1}It was all because they{3}were fighting Moapa up{3}on Trial Road...{2}
Nobody got to watch the{3}challenge at Trial Road. It{3}was just too far from town.{1}What a stupid law, that makes{3}us hide away and miss all{3}the battles!{2}
For years, the people of Hesperia{3}fought against the people of{3}Atteka...{1}Our own Shaman Village was{3}caught up in this war, as{3}were the people of Contigo.{2}
In those dark times, Contigo{3}and Shaman fought repeatedly{3}to protect our lands.{1}We fought to no avail, until{3}we decided to let Hoabna and{3}Yegelos fight for the outcome.{2}
The battles between Shaman{3}and Contigo were terrible, and{3}few warriors ever survived.{1}Eventually, our towns chose{3}Hoabna and Yegelos to fight{3}as our champions.{2}
I've always wondered why the{3}final battle between Hoabna{3}and Yegelos took place here.{1}I think Yegelos was really{3}brave for traveling here all{3}the way from Contigo.{2}
I had thought that, after{3}Yegelos, Contigo remained{3}without a new hero.{1}Now, suddenly, a hero shows{3}up who is mightier even than{3}Moapa. It's beyond belief!{2} 
The stories always said that{3}the heroes of Contigo were{3}inferior to our own.{1}Now, I'm not so sure... It{3}sounded like a fair match,{3}and yet Shaman's hero lost.{2}
Grandma and Grandpa have{3}been in a terrible mood since{3}they heard Moapa lost...{1}They're probably tired of being{3}asked about the ancient war{3}between Atteka and Hesperia.{2}
Everyone always comes to ask{3}Grandma and Grandpa about the{3}old battles of legend.{1}It's all anyone ever talks to{3}them about anymore. I'll bet{3}they're tired of it.{2}
Hoolabaloo!{2}
So, you'd like to hear{3}your fortune, would you?{30}
That's probably good. The{3}things I see are not for{3}everyone to hear.{2}
Well, you caught me in a{3}good mood... I'll do it!{2}
Hoolabaloo!{2}
Ballabahoo!{2}
Hoolabaloola!{2}
I can see it clearly... Your{3}life is thick with danger...{2}
Ooo... Wow, that was a strong{3}one... Listen, don't go south.{3}Bad stuff down there. Wow.{2}
Oh, it's terrible! Awful beyond{3}words! No more, no more!{2}
You should absolutely not go{3}south. Do you hear me? I'm{3}serious about this...{2}
That's weird... Everything is{3}cloudy... The ether is gray{3}and full of mists...{1}The world is undergoing some{3}sort of change, it seems.{2} 
So, you'd like to hear{3}your fortune, would you?{30}
That's probably good. The{3}things I see are not for{3}everyone to hear.{2}
Well, you caught me in a{3}good mood... I'll do it!{2}
Wallamafoo!{2}
Ballabahoo!{2}
Whazupwichoo!{2}
I can see it clearly... Your{3}life is thick with danger...{2}
Ooo... Wow, that was a strong{3}one... North by northeast is...{3}bad. Bad stuff up there. Wow.{2}
Oh, it's terrible! Awful beyond{3}words! No more, no more!{2}
Listen, I want you to promise{3}me you'll NEVER go north by{3}northeast. You got that?{2}
That's weird... Everything is{3}cloudy... The ether is gray{3}and full of mists...{1}The world is undergoing some{3}sort of change, it seems.{2} 
Your attacks showed skill{3}and speed, but if we meet{3}in battle again, I won't lose.{2}
I don't think the other villagers{3}will ever forgive us for losing{3}to you on Trial Road.{1}If they had any idea how{3}strong you are, they wouldn't{3}be complaining.{2}
Just climbing to the top of{3}Trial Road is excruciating.{1}It must have been hard for{3}Yegelos and Hoabna, too.{2}
That wasn't a fair fight...{3}I was all worn out from the{3}climb... How could I fight?{1}How did Hoabna manage{3}to fight after climbing a{3}mountain like that!?{2}
You have defeated me, and{3}yet I still don't know your{3}names... Would you tell me?{30}
A warrior who does not{3}share his name is a{3}humble warrior indeed.{2}
{17}{5}, {17}{6}, {17}{7},{3}and {17}{8}. I shall remember{3}those names.{1}We do not forget the names{3}of heroes who can defeat{3}me in fair combat.{2}
Moapa said that he doesn't{3}even know the names of the{3}heroes who beat him...{1}He feels bad for not having{3}asked. Maybe you should{3}go tell him your names.{2}
In a formal battle, it is both{3}customary and honorable to{3}give your name.{1}It's not too late for you...{3}Please go tell my father{3}your names.{2}
Why does it matter if you{3}know the name of someone{3}who beat you or not?{2}
If a warrior beats you, you{3}must learn his name...{1}Not many people have beaten{3}me, and they deserve my{3}respect.{2}
I would feel bad not knowing{3}the name of a warrior who{3}defeated me, I guess...{2}
What a shame... My own father,{3}losing to some ignorant{3}foreigner with bad manners.{2}
It's so old-fashioned to have{3}to give your name to an{3}opponent before a battle.{2}
I'll never forget the name{3}of anyone I fight.{2}
I was stunned to hear that{3}Moapa lost his battle...{1}His weapons all came from{3}my own warehouse, so I feel{3}a little responsible.{2}
Everyone is depressed that{3}Moapa lost his big fight. They{3}should be glad the hero came!{2}
Although it's not right to{3}blame his loss on the{3}weapons he used.{1}I couldn't afford it if that{3}rumor started going around.{2}
My husband is getting neurotic,{3}worrying about whether his{3}weapons caused the loss.{2}
You've traveled to lots of{3}different lands, haven't you?{30}
That explains it... The only{3}reason you won is because{3}of your travels...{1}Your strange, exotic{3}weapons are what won{3}the day, not your skill.{2}
I could have sworn that{3}fancy boat was yours...{1}If you can afford such a{3}nice boat, you can probably{3}afford nice weapons, too.{2}
We're very fond of Moapa{3}here. He's a great leader.{1}If anyone in town says{3}something mean to you,{3}please forgive them.{2}
I've been locked up inside{3}all day! I'm so glad to get{3}outside and stretch!{2}
Ah... I've been inside for so{3}long... I think I'll have a little{3}picnic! But what should I eat...{2}
Around here, people like a{3}nice hot steak and some{3}potatoes and beans...{1}You foreigners might be used{3}to strange, exotic food, but{3}we like our meals simple.{2}
Moapa has been miserable{3}since his defeat. If only I could{3}have taken his place up there.{2}
It drives me nuts how{3}worked up everyone gets{3}about Moapa around here.{2}
All of the older people in town{3}are really upset that Moapa{3}lost...{1}It doesn't matter to us kids.{3}I think they're too hung up{3}on tradition.{2} 
I'm starving! I can't wait until{3}dinner! I love my meat and{3}potatoes! And BEANS!!!{1}It must be the spices the{3}chef uses... Lots of salt,{3}and lots of pepper!{2}
Those fancy foreign chefs{3}use all sorts of spices to{3}hide the flavor of their food.{1}As far as I'm concerned,{3}there are only two spices:{3}salt and pepper.{2}
You beat Moapa? Incredible!{3}...Not that I ever doubted you!{2}
Don't be too pleased with{3}yourself for beating Moapa.{1}One of these days, we'll{3}come storming into Contigo,{3}and we'll show you what's what!{2}
Oh, please... Let a true{3}warrior be born in Shaman.{3}Let us forget this disgrace!{2}
The older folks of Shaman{3}are quite upset that Moapa{3}was beaten.{1}I'm afraid this might lead{3}to renewed fighting between{3}Shaman and Contigo.{2}
Moapa must have been{3}hungry after climbing the{3}mountain...{1}That's the only way those{3}lousy Contigo nobodies{3}could have beaten him.{2}
I can't forgive the fact{3}that Contigo's heroes beat{3}our leader, Moapa...{1}I hope a new hero is born in{3}Shaman, one who can crush{3}those Contigo barbarians...{2}
{17}{5}, the hero of Contigo!{3}I shall never forget you, the{3}only one that defeated me!{2}
{17}{5}, {17}{6}, {17}{7},{3}and {17}{8}... I won't forget{3}those names...{1}Someday, their names will be{3}engraved on the columns{3}leading to Trial Road.{2}
Ahhhh!!!
{17}{4}!
Noooo!!!
Oof!
{17}{4}!
{17}{2}!
Is that...{5} It's {17}{1}{3}and the others!{2}
{17}{1}? Isn't he a friend{3}of yours, {17}{5}?{30}
They both come from Vale, and{3}regardless of what {17}{1}{3}believes, they must be allies now!{2}
Don't be that way! You two have{3}much in common, even if you are{3}at odds right now...{2}
But {17}{1} and the others{3}came all this way just to try{3}and stop us!{2}
But didn't you hear that? It{3}sounded like a cry for help...{3}What if they're in trouble?{2}
Hang on, {17}{4}!{3}Don't worry, {17}{2}!{3}Everything will be fine!{2}
Don't worry about me... I'm{3}fine, but {17}{2}...{2}
{17}{2}, you're only using{3}one arm to hang on...{3}What's the matter?{2}
I don't know... I think I hurt my{3}arm when I fell... It's totally{3}numb! I can't move it!{2}
You shouldn't have tried{3}to save me when I fell{3}into that hole...{2}
Oh, {17}{4}, don't blame{3}yourself... I wasn't going to{3}leave you down there!{2}
It's no use! I can't pull{3}you up, {17}{2}! I'm{3}not strong enough!{2}
{17}{1}, please! You've{3}got to save {17}{2}!{2}
This doesn't look good...{3}We have to save {17}{2},{3}and fast!{2}
No, I'm afraid you won't{3}be doing that...{2}
Who are you!?{2}
Me? Why, I'm Karst.{2}
And I'm Agatio.{2}
If you're not here to help my{3}friend, then get out of my{3}way, so I can do it myself!{2}
Your friends will have to take{3}care of themselves. You have{3}a little debt to repay.{2}
Debt? What are you talking{3}about? We've never even{3}seen you before!{2}
Regardless, you have done Karst{3}here a great wrong, and you're{3}beginning to be a hindrance to us.{2}
Wait a second... You two look{3}familiar somehow... Do you{3}know Saturos and Menardi?{2}
So, you're not such a fool{3}after all, {17}{1}! You are{3}right. We are of the same clan.{1}The Fire Clan, from the frozen{3}land of Prox, far to the north!{2}{2}
Prox? Never heard of it.{2}
That doesn't surprise me.{3}Our town hangs on the{3}brink of extinction.{2}
And the seal placed on{3}Alchemy is responsible!{2}
What are you saying? That{3}doesn't make any sense.{2}
It matters not! For soon, Prox{3}will recover its lost power...{2}
We shall bring Prox back from{3}the edge, and then all the people{3}of Weyard will kneel before us!{2}
You think we'd let you, after{3}hearing all that nonsense?{2}
See! You're a hindrance!{2}
And {17}{5} was trying{3}to help you?{2}
Actually...we don't know what{3}{17}{5}'s objectives are.{2}
And we don't care, as long{3}as he lights the beacon on{3}Jupiter Lighthouse.{2}
Then get out of our way!{3}We're here to stop {17}{5}!{2}
Move, or we'll have to{3}move you ourselves!{2}
Did you hear that, Karst?{3}They actually want to fight?{2}
You mean to tell us that{3}you would leave your{3}friend...hanging?{2}
So this was all part{3}of your plan?{2}
Cowards! Stop playing{3}dirty and fight fair!{2}
If you really are the brats who{3}killed Saturos and Menardi, then{3}you've earned some new foes!{2}
But answer me this: would{3}you still cry foul if you were{3}fighting us four on two?{2}
That's why you were waiting{3}up here? To set a trap and{3}make {17}{4} and {17}{2} fall?{2}
We didn't plan on snaring{3}both of them, though... That{3}{9}{2}was{7} a pleasant surprise!{2}
So that's the deal, is it?{3}You came up here to fight us?{2}
Oh, did you figure that out all{3}on your own? Impressive! I'm{3}quite fond of intelligent boys...{2}
I hope you don't think{3}we're afraid of a fair{3}fight, two on two...{2}
A fair fight?{2}
I'm sorry if I misled you, but we{3}have a third... A Water Adept...{3}Alex!{2}
Alex?{5} ...Where is he?{2}
What's wrong, Karst?{2}
It's Alex! He's gone!{2}
What!?{2}
Alex!
Alex?
Did anyone see where{3}he went?{2}
Forget about him! Honestly, I{3}was planning to do the same to{3}him that I'm about to do to them!{2}
My only regret is that I{3}won't be able to wipe that{3}sneering smile off his face.{2}
Well, take out all of your{3}aggressions on these brats...{3}You'll feel better!{2}
{17}{5}! Agatio and Karst{3}are attacking {17}{1}{3}and the others!{2}
Do you think {17}{1} and{3}{17}{3} can handle them{3}without {17}{4} and {17}{2}'s help?{2}
I'm disgusted that Karst{3}would set a trap for them.{3}It's dishonorable!{2}
What if {17}{2} loses his{3}grip while they're still fighting?{2}
There's still time! We have to{3}help {17}{1}!{2}
Ah, {17}{5}... I've been{3}waiting for you.{2}
Have you come here to{3}light the beacon?{30}
And you're sure that's{3}{9}{2}all{7} you're going to do?{2}
Hmph. They consider you their{3}enemy, and yet you pity them.{2}
I saw you watching when{3}{17}{1}'s friends fell{3}into Karst's trap.{2}
I know you, {17}{5}.{5}{3}I know that if you leave{3}{17}{1} behind, you'll regret it.{2}
You're not like me. You can't{3}simply discard someone who{3}is no longer of use to you.{2}
Well, you'd better hurry if you{3}still hope to save them.{2}
Everyone recovered fully.{2}
There you go! Consider it a{3}gift. You can still make it.{3}Go on...{2}
It is time you followed your{3}true feelings. Go on.{3}Save your friends.{2}
Even now, I want to run to{3}{17}{4}, to give her my aid...{3}It seems I am weak as well...{1}I suppose I have no choice{3}but to part ways with Agatio{3}and Karst.{2}
{17}{1}... I'm sorry...{3}I can't take any more...{2}
Keep it together, {17}{3}!{2}
Ha! You're a fool! Never let{3}concern distract you in battle!{2}
AHHHHHHHH!!!{2}
We did it, Agatio!{2}
It was close, but we did it.{2}
Heh... He's no warrior. His{3}concern for his friend gave{3}us the opportunity to strike!{2}
What's this? He's still alive!?{3}Even after that blow?{2}
It would be a shame if you{3}and I ever had to regret letting{3}him live...{2}
{17}{1}! Watch out!{2}
He's still alive! If we're going to{3}act, {17}{5}, we have to act now!{2}
They're going to kill {17}{1}!{2}
No, they aren't! I'm not about{3}to let that happen!{2}
None of us are, {17}{6}!{2}
{17}{5}? What's going on?{2}
Be grateful! We just{3}did you a favor!{2}
I understand that when Venus{3}was lit, the ground shook so{3}fiercely that the very earth split.{1}Curious that it hasn't here!{2}
You haven't lit the beacon{3}yet, have you? And after all{3}we've done to help you!{2}
We're going to light the{3}beacon right now...{2}
If that's true, then you'd{3}better go do it!{2}
But we're not leaving{3}{17}{1} behind.{2}
Oh, great... Are you going{3}to betray us now?{30}
Typical. And you're going to{3}try to stop us from finishing{3}them off, aren't you?{2}
Don't lie... We can see it in{3}your eyes. We can see what{3}you truly mean to do.{2}
If you're only here to clear{3}the way for us to light the{3}beacon, then your work is done.{2}
{17}{1} has proven to{3}be a greater foe than we'd{3}imagined. We can't let him live.{2}
Consider how powerful these two{3}were without the aid of a Water{3}Adept. We have to finish them.{2}
If you want them, you're going{3}to have to face us first!{2}
You're both quite badly{3}injured... You're in no shape{3}to fight all four of them.{1}I think it would be best{3}if you left now.{2}
We haven't much choice...{2}
Karst, no!{2}
Agatio, if we fight {17}{5}{3}now...we'll be destroyed.{2}
{17}{1} killed your sister!{3}Where is your anger!?{2}
I am filled with rage, but not so{3}much as to be blinded by it.{2}
What, then? Do we give up?{2}
Fine! But this is not the end.{2}
Do with {17}{1}{3}as you will.{2}
But swear this oath to us:{3}if we leave now, you will{3}light the beacon's fire.{30}
I don't care if you want to{3}help {17}{2} or not!{3}The lighthouse comes first!{2}
We do not have time to wait{3}for you to save {17}{2}!{2}
Go, {17}{5}.{3}I will tend to {17}{2}.{2}
And be sure to bring with{3}you the Mars Star that{3}{17}{1} carries on him.{2}
How did you know{3}about the Mars Star?{2}
Did you think this was about{3}nothing more than revenge?{3}Alex told us about it!{2}
Take the Mars Star, or we'll{3}be forced to make you!{2}
Do not force our{3}hand on this!{2}
Go on, {17}{5}. Take it.{2}
I don't know why you're doing{3}this, but I trust you...{3}Take the Mars Star.{2}
{17}{5} took the Mars Star.{2}
That's better, {17}{5}.{3}We'll be waiting for you{3}on the aerie.{2}
{17}{5}, wait...{2}
We cannot trust them.{3}Take me with you...{2}
Good thinking. If something{3}happens up there, you'll be{3}safer with {17}{8}.{2}
We'll be fine. Take{3}{17}{8} with you...{2}
Listen to the others...{3}Safety in numbers, as{3}they say...{2}
{28}{5}{1}, {17}{5}... No!{3}Why are you helping them?{2}
Don't worry about us... Help{3}{17}{2} and {17}{4} first.{2}
We have to help {17}{2}.{3}He can't hold on for much{3}longer.{2}
{17}{1}! I don't know how{3}you survived that attack,{3}but I'm so glad you did...{1}We're going to help you...{3}We're going to heal you...{2}
{17}{3}... You've been injured.{3}Don't worry about the others.{3}Let's take care of those wounds.{2}
Why did you help us, {17}{5}?{3}Whatever it was, I'm glad you{3}stopped to help us...{1}But why do you have to{3}still light the beacon?{2}
I thought you were our{3}enemy, {17}{5}... Why did{3}you stop to help us?{2}
{17}{2} and {17}{4} are{3}back. They fell through that{3}hole, and then this panel...{2}
{17}{1}! Look at you!{3}You're a mess! I thought I'd{3}never see you again...{2}
You're pretty tough for your{3}age... I'm impressed, {17}{3}.{2}
You're late, {17}{5}!{2}
Now light the beacon!{2}
Once you've lit the beacon,{3}we might even forgive you{3}for saving {17}{1} back there.{2}
Once Jupiter is lit, only{3}Mars remains! Now, light{3}the beacon!{2}
Once Jupiter is lit, we'll have no{3}need for you. Just watch...{2}
Do even think about{3}resisting us... We have{3}our own ideas about that.{1}Once the beacon is lit,{3}your usefulness will have{3}run out for good.{2}
There seems to be a wide{3}hole for the Elemental Star.{1}Cast the Jupiter Star in?{30}
We have ignited the beacon...{3}The third lighthouse is lit...{3}Now let us go...{2}
I don't think so...{2}
You see, you've betrayed{3}us once already...{2}
We simply can't trust{3}you anymore...{2}
And now that Jupiter{3}Lighthouse is lit, I'm afraid we{3}have little use for traitors.{2}
Poor dear... You look puzzled.{3}Would you like to know{3}why we don't need you?{30}
I'd be happy to tell you. Mars{3}Lighthouse{5} is in Prox.{2}
Figured it out, have you?{3}Yes, Mars Lighthouse is in{3}Prox.{2}
What are you doing!?{2}
They stole the Mars Star!{2}
Your job is done now.{2}
We're not done yet...{2}
We've got the Mars Star!{3}We don't need you anymore!{2}
You know what that means,{3}of course, don't you?{30}
Exactly! That means it's{3}time to die, {17}{5}!{2}
No? Well, how can I put this?{3}It's time to die!{2}
But what will happen to{3}{17}{5}'s parents?{2}
We keep our promises! Once all{3}four lighthouses have been{3}lit, we shall release them!{2}
We would never do anything as{3}terrible as breaking our word...{3}as you have done so casually.{2}
But if you're dead...{3}Who will come to take{3}them home from Prox?{2}
I guess they'll just have to spend{3}their remaining years in the{3}frozen wastelands of the north!{2}
Don't worry! They'll be fine!{3}Now prepare for the end!{2}
{17}{5}!{2}
I thought you were taking too{3}long, so I came to check on{3}you. What's going on?{2}
They say they don't{3}need us anymore...{2}
Agatio! {17}{5}'s sister isn't{3}supposed to be here...{2}
What do you want me to{3}do? We can't just leave{3}now! We have to finish them!{2}
Don't worry, {17}{5}!{3}I'm here to help!{2}
{17}{6}!{2}
I got the feeling something was{3}wrong, so I rushed up here. Just{3}in the nick of time, it looks like!{2}
Thank you, {17}{7}! I'm{3}not looking forward to fighting,{3}but I'm glad you're here.{2}
Another one? Agatio, we're{3}rapidly being outnumbered!{2}
It's too late to flee now! We{3}have to keep fighting!{2}
{17}{1} and the others{3}are safe! Now let's take care{3}of these two rats!{2}
We did it...{3}We beat them...{2}
Barely...{2}
What should we do with them?{2}
Finish us!{2}
But think: what happens to{3}your parents if neither we nor{3}Saturos and Menardi return?{2}
Are you saying your people{3}will kill our parents if you don't{3}return to Prox? I doubt that!{2}
Well then, I suppose you'd{3}better finish us off, like I said.{2}
What's the matter? Are you{3}going to do it or not?{30}
No, {17}{5}! Don't!{2}
You've made the better{3}choice, {17}{5}.{2}
When did you get here, Alex?{2}
If Karst is not bluffing... If you{3}kill them, all of your efforts{3}will have been for naught.{2}
Do you understand, {17}{5}?{3}If that happens, {17}{1} will{3}suffer the same fate you do...{2}
Alex! What are you doing!?{2}
I have revived them.{2}
Why!? Are you going to make{3}us fight them again?{2}
Don't worry, {17}{6}.{3}Look at them... They can barely{3}walk right now.{2}
Still, that doesn't give you{3}the right to...{2}
If you're not going to finish{3}them off, you'll just be leaving{3}them here, won't you?{2}
You're not going to help{3}us defeat these brats?{2}
You'd better not be expecting{3}a big thank-you for this, Alex!{2}
Of course not, Karst.{3}I would never ask for{3}your gratitude.{2}
What's keeping {17}{5}{3}and the others?{2}
We should be going before{3}{17}{1} and the others arrive.{2}
If they're coming up, how do{3}you plan on avoiding them{3}on your way down?{2}
Do not worry about us...{3}We'll just take the elevator.{2}
Now that the lighthouse has{3}been lit, it should be fully{3}operational again.{2}
Oh! You're looking better!{2}
{17}{5}, {17}{6}...{2}
{17}{1}... {17}{2}...{2}
Man! They got away!{3}What a bunch of jerks!{2}
All right, {17}{5}! We want{3}to know what's going on!{2}
It's all quite complicated,{3}{17}{1}. There are a number{3}of{5} extenuating circumstances.{2}
What are you talking{3}about, Kraden?{2}
Look, I don't think any of{3}us are in any shape for{3}another fight right now.{2}
What do you mean, {17}{3}?{2}
I'm just saying we should{3}get ourselves back to Contigo{3}and sort things out there.{2}
That's a sound plan, {17}{3}...{3}I fully agree.{2}
You're right. We can't fight{3}right now. Let's head back{3}to Contigo.{1}What do you say, {17}{5}?{3}Can we talk there?{2}
We'll be waiting for you...{3}So don't think you can{3}sneak off again!{2}
He's right, {17}{5}. It's time{3}we explained ourselves to them.{3}We should go to Contigo.{2}
We'll be there, {17}{1}.{3}I promise. I hope you can{3}still trust me.{2}
I've never stopped trusting{3}you, {17}{6}. I'll be waiting{3}for you in Contigo.{2}
We'll be expecting you. Don't{3}think you can sneak out of this!{3}You owe us an explanation!{2}
{17}{1} wasn't the only{3}surprise. They were all far more{3}powerful than I'd expected.{2}
Don't worry, Karst! We'll win{3}in the end...{2}
This one moved... I can't{3}believe they're still alive!{3}The pests!{2}
If we stay here much longer,{3}{17}{1} and the others{3}will come! We should leave!{2}
I know... But treason deserves{3}death! We must finish them!{2}
There's no time for{3}petty grudges!{2}
Alex! You...{2}
You no longer consider me{3}a friend? I do not care.{2}
It goes beyond that, Alex!{3}You've betrayed us, and{3}treason deserves death!{2}
Yes, I heard you the first time.{1}But shouldn't you heal{3}yourselves before making{3}foolish threats?{2}
After fighting both {17}{1}{3}and {17}{5}, you're in no{3}condition to fight me.{2}
And if {17}{1} and the others{3}come, what chance will you have?{2}
What's keeping {17}{5}{3}and the others?{2}
There's no time to talk!{2}
Then what should we do?{2}
We take the elevator! With{3}the beacon lit, it should be{3}fully operational once more.{2}
We have no choice. Let's go.{2}
Good! You're listening to{3}reason! Now follow me!{2}
{17}{5}! {17}{6}!{2}
What's happened?{2}
It seems they fought with{3}Agatio and Karst...{2}
I had a really bad feeling{3}after {17}{7} left.{3}I hate it when I'm right...{2}
Your power of prediction must{3}be even stronger than you'd{3}thought, {17}{3}...{2}
Blast! They must have taken{3}the elevator to escape!{2}
How could they have done{3}that to {17}{6}? Those monsters!{2}
{17}{5} tried to help us...{3}They must have attacked him{3}because he betrayed them.{2}
So, does that mean {17}{5}{3}isn't really our enemy?{2}
{17}{5}! You're alive!{2}
{17}{4}, he needs healing,{3}quickly! There's still time!{2}
Don't let 'em die! {17}{5}{3}still has a lot of questions to{3}answer before he's in the clear!{2}
If you save {17}{5}, we'll{3}tell you everything...{2}
All right, {17}{5}! We want{3}to know what's going on!{2}
It's all quite complicated,{3}{17}{1}. There are a number{3}of{5} extenuating circumstances.{2}
What are you talking{3}about, Kraden?{2}
Look, I don't think any of{3}us are in any shape for{3}another fight right now.{2}
What do you mean, {17}{3}?{2}
I'm just saying we should{3}get ourselves back to Contigo{3}and sort things out there.{2}
That's a sound plan, {17}{3}...{3}I fully agree.{2}
You're right. We can't fight{3}right now. Let's head back{3}to Contigo.{1}What do you say, {17}{5}?{3}Can we talk there?{2}
We'll be waiting for you...{3}So don't think you can{3}sneak off again!{2}
He's right, {17}{5}. It's time{3}we explained ourselves to them.{3}We should go to Contigo.{2}
We'll be there, {17}{1}.{3}I promise. I hope you can{3}still trust me.{2}
I've never stopped trusting{3}you, {17}{6}. I'll be waiting{3}for you in Contigo.{2}
We'll be expecting you. Don't{3}think you can sneak out of this!{3}You owe us an explanation!{2}
The door's locked.{2}
Holder of the star...{3}Show the power of Anemos!{2}
You didn't warn me that there{3}would be an earthquake when{3}the beacon was lit!{2}
The core is shining so{3}brightly already...{2}
I've heard tales of this...{2}
But I had no idea it would{3}be so spectacular.{2}
I've heard tales of this...{2}
But I had no idea it would{3}be so spectacular.{2}
You're not planning on running{3}away from {17}{1} again, are you?{2}
We can't run anymore, {17}{5}.{3}I promised him that we wouldn't.{2}
Besides, they want to talk,{3}not fight...{2}
They're waiting for us.{3}Let's go to Contigo.{2}
We shouldn't run from {17}{1}{3}anymore, {17}{5}.{2}
Are you looking for {17}{1}?{3}He and his colleagues are in the{3}house at the top of the hill.{1}Are you the people they've{3}been waiting for?{2}
Everyone's left town for the{3}time being. They're transporting{3}the wings...{1}Actually, they might even have{3}finished putting them onto the{3}ship by now.{2}
Is that your boat? It looks{3}exactly like the one in the{3}geoglyphs.{2}
Jupiter Lighthouse has been lit,{3}for the first time in years...{3}Did you feel that earthquake?{1}If that's what happens when{3}the lighthouses shine, I wish{3}that it had stayed dark!{2}
They look like they're in{3}for some trouble. Oh well...{3}I ain't a'gonna help 'em.{2}
The prophecies are all coming{3}true... We're living in some{3}strange times, it seems.{2}
It's just like the legends said...{3}The ship in the geoglyphs has{3}finally come to Contigo.{2}
What does it mean, when{3}ancient legends are turning{3}out to be true?{1}I just want the world to go{3}back to the way it was before.{2}
I'm glad you kept your{3}promise, {17}{5}.{2}
All right, let's hear what he{3}has to say for himself!{2}
What can we say, {17}{1}?{3}Has {17}{5} ever harmed you?{3}Have we ever fought against you?{2}
{17}{5}'s been avoiding you,{3}but he never had any intention{3}of fighting you or anything...{2}
And he definitely helped us out{3}back at Jupiter Lighthouse.{2}
{17}{1}'s been worrying about{3}{17}{6} nonstop since this{3}nightmare began!{1}How could she run away{3}from him like that?{2}
She was afraid that if we{3}met, we would be forced to{3}fight... She didn't want that.{2}
I know that, now... But it doesn't{3}explain why you're doing this...{2}
{17}{5} betrayed his hometown,{3}Vale... That's why he hasn't been{3}able to face {17}{1}.{2}
{17}{5} had hoped to play{3}the villain alone, without getting{3}{17}{6} or me involved...{2}
He betrayed Vale? Kraden,{3}what are you talking about?{2}
He conspired to steal the{3}Elemental Stars and fire the{3}beacons of the four lighthouses.{2}
That's what Saturos and Menardi{3}were trying to do...{2}
Why were you helping them?{2}
Our parents' lives were at{3}stake! We had to help!{2}
Parents? But...your parents died{3}three years ago, in that storm...{2}
That night, Saturos and his men{3}had raided Sol Sanctum... The{3}storm was their doing.{2}
{17}{2}, you saw two{3}strangers that night{176}Saturos{3}and Menardi.{1}They were the only survivors{3}of Saturos's raiding party.{2}
They had failed to solve the{3}mystery of Sol Sanctum. In doing{3}so, they triggered the storm.{2}
Everyone thought that you{3}were killed by that boulder,{3}{17}{5}.{1}I can't tell you how glad I was{3}to find you were alive!{2}
In fact, nobody was killed{3}by the boulder that day!{2}
So that means...{2}
Wait a minute, Kraden...{3}Did you just say that {9}{2}nobody{7}{3}was killed by that boulder?{2}
But what about {17}{1}'s dad?{3}And {17}{6} and {17}{5}'s parents?{3}I thought they'd died that day!{2}
I'm not so sure now...{2}
Yes! If {17}{5} survived,{3}Kyle and the others may have{3}as well...{2}
Why didn't you tell us? We{3}could have worked together to{3}save your parents, couldn't we?{30}
Except that we had only just{3}begun our journey, and we{3}simply weren't strong enough.{2}
He's right. They were too{3}powerful then... It would have{3}been impossible.{2}
There's more to it than that.{3}He had another reason to{3}light the lighthouse beacons.{2}
Unless the lighthouse beacons{3}are all lit, Weyard will eventually{3}be destroyed.{2}
Destroyed?{3}But...how? Why?{2}
King Hydros, ruler of Lemuria,{3}says that our world is steadily{3}shrinking.{2}
Elemental energy drives the{3}growth of civilization. Without{3}it, we and our world will wither.{2}
All that because the lighthouses{3}aren't illuminated?{2}
According to my research,{3}that seems to be the case.{2}
But...once the lighthouses{3}are all lit, you said the world{3}would end anyway!{2}
That...might be true, too... But{3}if we do nothing, the world{3}will definitely end.{2}
Wait for the end of the world{3}to come or wind up accidentally{3}triggering it ourselves...{1}What a choice...{2}
Nothing is certain. There is{3}no way to prevent the world{3}from reaching its natural end.{2}
However, we can fight to save{3}the world from withering away{3}due to the actions of men.{2}
And, {17}{5}, you knew this?{3}You were helping them because{3}you knew what was happening?{30}
You're a lot smarter than{3}I remember you being...{2}
You just figured it out along{3}the way, huh? That's still{3}pretty darned smart.{2}
Why did you wait so long{3}to tell me? I would have{3}helped you...{2}
You wouldn't have done it{3}before, {17}{1}...{1}It would have meant violating{3}the sacred teachings of Vale.{2}
Now that we know all of{3}this, shouldn't we be going?{2}
Hamma!{2}
Hello again...{2}
Hamma! You...know {17}{1}?{3}And his companions, too?{2}
We met at the temple on the{3}edge of the Lamakan Desert...
I'm Hamma, descendant{3}of the Anemos.
I was born in Contigo, and{3}I inherited the power of{3}the Anemos.{2}
Hey... We just got into Contigo,{3}and we found out this is where{3}{17}{3} was born!{2}
Yeah... We also learned{3}that he's got a sister!{2}
Sister... You don't mean...{2}
That would be me, yes.{2}
Not now, {17}{3}...{3}This isn't the time.{2}
Three lighthouses have been{3}lit... The elements have been{3}thrown out of balance.{2}
Jupiter is growing stronger,{3}and the north grows colder{3}with every passing moment.{2}
You must hurry to Mars{3}Lighthouse. Ignite its beacon,{3}before all of Weyard freezes...{2}
Mars Lighthouse? Agatio{3}has the Mars Star. He's{3}on his way to light it now!{2}
I doubt they will be able to{3}light the Mars beacon...{2}
Why's that?{2}
There is a powerful force{3}that does not want to see{3}Mars rekindled.{2}
You will fail as well...unless{3}you pool your strengths{3}together and fight as one.{2}
This is bad.{3}We have to go...now!{2}
I had hoped that you{3}would feel that way...{2}
I've prepared a gift for you,{3}to aid you on your way to{3}Mars Lighthouse.{2}
I must leave you now, but{3}we will meet at the inlet.{2}
I'm sorry we left Venus{3}Lighthouse without seeing you...{3}I'm sorry for making you worry...{2}
Maybe when this is all over, we{3}can all go on a trip together.{2}
Hey, {17}{6}, you sure seem{3}calm, considering that we're{3}racing to meet our enemies...{2}
I'm just relieved that we've{3}sorted our differences...{2}
Me too, {17}{4}... We could{3}not have stood divided{3}against a common foe.{2}
Yeah, I guess I'm a little{3}happy that we're not going{3}to have to beat {17}{5} up.{2}
Listen, this is {17}{5}'s quest{3}now... We're just doing what{3}we can to help out...{2}
Aren't you happy?{30}
Everything's finally come{3}together... This is how it was{3}meant to be, {17}{5}.{2}
Don't worry about the future,{3}{17}{5}... Enjoy this brief{3}moment's happiness.{2}
But Hamma's waiting for us.{3}Let's go to our ship!{2}
You have to hurry! I think{3}the ship from the geoglyphs{3}is going to take off soon!{2}
First, the lighthouse is lit, and{3}now, we're going to see a{3}flying boat! It's like a festival!{2}
The boss said it was all right{3}for us to go to the inlet once{3}all the customers leave.{1}So hurry up and leave,{3}so we can go watch{3}the boat!{2}
They've finished putting the{3}wings on the boat, but I don't{3}see what the big deal is.{1}It's just a flying boat, for{3}crying out loud!{2}
Once all our customers{3}leave, I'm free to go. So{3}hurry up already!{2}
I can't believe it... All of the{3}hopes of the people of Atteka{3}have come true here, in Contigo!{1}It's like a miracle, a dream{3}come true! This calls for{3}a festival!{2}
All these years, I thought it was{3}just a children's story, but now{3}it's all coming true...{2}
It was kind of impressive{3}watching the procession{3}carrying those wings, though...{2}
A flying ship... Surely, it must{3}be a miracle. I'll have to{3}study this closely.{2}
Perhaps if I see a miracle{3}with my own eyes, my faith{3}will be restored once more...{2}
Hamma returned to Contigo{3}after all these years... Right{3}when we finished the wings!{2}
Was your boat really the same{3}one in the geoglyph? What's{3}that all about?{2}
Everyone's waiting down by{3}the beach.{1}They all want to see the boat{3}fly with their own eyes.{2}
A massive rock blocked the{3}entrance to the inlet after the{3}lighthouse beacon was lit...{1}If that ship's ever going to{3}leave the inlet, it's gonna{3}have to fly to do it.{2}
Where do you think you're going?{2}
We worked really hard{3}on that ship of yours!{2}
I want to see our handiwork{3}take flight. Don't you, buddy?{2}
I want to!  Boy, do I want to!{2}
So hurry up!{3}We want to see the boat fly!{2}
Thanks, buddy!{2}
The villagers are all waiting to{3}see the ship fly. So how's about{3}getting on with the flying!?{2}
Hamma wouldn't let us get{3}any closer, so we're waiting{3}here to watch the ship leave.{2}
When people work together,{3}even a little spiritual power{3}can work great wonders.{1}We sent everyone back to{3}the village so that their hopes{3}would not impair your flight.{2}
We've been working forever{3}on getting these wings{3}onto the boat!{1}We're not used to working like{3}this... It's making me dizzy!{2}
Who built the boat from the{3}geoglyph, anyway?{1}Is there another tribe that's{3}descended from the Anemos{3}besides our tribe in Contigo?{2}
Hamma is the new leader of{3}Contigo. She bears the powers{3}of the Anemos, after all.{1}But I still think she shouldn't{3}be ordering us to help fix{3}up your boat.{2}
If that boat's gonna get out{3}of the inlet, it's gonna have{3}to fly. I want to see that.{2}
It's amazing to think that my{3}hard work is going to help{3}make that boat fly.{2}
Hamma says that our own{3}hopes and dreams might{3}prevent the boat from flying.{1}It's as though, by wanting it{3}too much, we'll actually{3}prevent it from happening.{2}
We can't get too close to{3}the boat, or it might not fly...{1}We've just got to have{3}everyone watch from afar.{2}
It's almost time... Time to{3}watch a legend become reality!{2}
If everyone will just obey{3}Hamma's request, the ship{3}will surely fly.{2}
When the winged ship of Anemos{3}flies once again, the whole land{3}shall be made free...{1}That's what the legend says,{3}anyway... But what land needs{3}freeing? We seem free enough...{2}
Once you remove the stone{3}anchors weighing the ship{3}down, it should fly...{2}
The day has finally come that{3}the ship will fly on the Wings{3}of Anemos...{2}
The Anemos were powerful,{3}sure, but can their power really{3}make a great ship fly?{1}No... No, I must not doubt...{3}I must have faith that it will{3}fly. It is meant to be.{2}
These warriors will know what{3}to do... They'll know how to{3}save the land...{2}
I hear that the warriors brought{3}the Hover Jade back with them...{1}Now, that's something that I'd{3}really like to see.{2}
I've been waiting for you,{3}{17}{5}.{2}
Take a look at your ship.{2}
Now that you have been given{3}wings, all obstacles in your{3}path will vanish forever...{2}
However, it is not the wings{3}alone that grant your ship{3}the power of flight.{2}
Psynergy is the force that{3}powers the Wings of Anemos.{2}
If the ship is to fly, you{3}will need to focus the{3}power of your minds...{2}
You have visited Shaman{3}Village recently, have you not?{2}
Now is the time to make{3}use of the powers you{3}acquired there.{2}
Now... Use the power of{3}Hover to raise your ship!{2}
At first, you may not want to{3}move your ship too high or{3}too far...{2}
It will be difficult at first, but{3}that is to be expected... After{3}all, this is your first flight.{2}
But your quest should not{3}demand much more of you...{2}
Now, be confident{3}and set sail!{2}
All of Contigo is watching...{3}Show them your power, and{3}make your vessel fly!{2}
Use your Psynergy to raise{3}your ship and fly over reefs.{2}
Travel safely, {17}{3}...{3}The world depends on you.{2}
I got stuck doing chores at{3}home, and I had to miss{3}watching the ship take off.{2}
Everyone's been going on{3}about how amazing it was{3}to watch the ship fly...{1}I wish I could have been{3}there to see it. I guess it{3}was pretty moving.{2}
It must be so exciting to{3}travel around the world{3}in a flying ship.{2}
Hamma was telling us that the{3}world is a dangerous place.{3}I wonder what she meant.{1}I think she's concerned about{3}the elemental balance...{2}
I saw the ship fly!{3}Now I want to see what it{3}looks like from on board!{2}
It wasn't what I expected,{3}but seeing the ship take{3}off was still amazing.{2}
I didn't get to see the ship{3}take off, but I'm not really{3}all that disappointed.{1}I heard that it wasn't{3}that impressive anyway.{2}
Some people were talking{3}about how the ship wasn't{3}really that impressive.{1}Why would they say that?{3}A ship actually flew{3}through the air!{2}
I couldn't fly in the air,{3}that's for sure. I get motion{3}sickness just walking around.{2}
I heard that the world could{3}freeze over soon... I hope{3}{17}{3} does what he needs to.{2}
The ship looked like it{3}had a few problems trying{3}to get off the ground.{1}I guess it was because{3}the crew had never made{3}a ship fly before.{2}
All of those legends did{3}nothing but build up people's{3}expectations.{1}I'm just glad to know that{3}the ship flew at all...{2}
I guess the lighthouse was{3}lit because {17}{3} and Hamma{3}finally returned to Contigo.{2}
{17}{3} doesn't remember{3}his mother, because he was{3}taken away at such an early age.{1}But I saw her eyes the day he{3}went away. Tears welled up,{3}and she couldn't stop crying.{2}
From the look on {17}{3}'s{3}face, whatever happened at the{3}lighthouse must have been bad.{2}
Hamma will stay with us, but{3}{17}{3} is leaving again.{1}The power of Anemos must{3}be a terrible responsibility{3}for such a young boy.{2}
I wonder how {17}{3} feels{3}now that he knows what{3}happened to his mother.{1}Hamma seems so closed up...{3}I wonder if she'll talk to him{3}about it...{2}
Someday, I'm gonna fight {17}{3},{3}and then I'll be the legendary{3}hero of Contigo!{2}
{9}{4}Brrr...Brrr... It's been really{3}cold since the lighthouse{3}beacon was lit!{2}
Winter just ended, but{3}it keeps getting colder.{3}What's going on?{2}
Jupiter Lighthouse has been{3}called the beacon of wind... Is{3}that why it's so windy and cold?{2}
Hamma says that if {17}{3}{3}fails, it will continue to get{3}colder and colder.{2}
The lighthouse has been lit,{3}and we've made a ship fly...{3}Our legends are coming to life!{2}
It's up to the people of{3}Contigo to live up to{3}our own legends.{2}
Mom and Dad have been{3}walking around in a daze{3}since the ship took off.{2}
The baby's forehead is{3}furrowed, like it's thinking.{2}
Goo goo. Gaa gaa... Waaa!{2}
Drafts! I hate drafts! This{3}stupid house is always cold!{2}
Now that we've finished the{3}wings, we should fix the house.{2}
{17}{3} has the power of{3}prophecy, but I'll bet he didn't{3}see this coming!{2}
Now that I think about it,{3}this very day will probably{3}become a legend, too!{2}
It's time to fix those drafts{3}now that the wings are done!{2}
Goo... It's getting colder...{3}Gagoo... I want a blanket...{2}
Ah, you've returned! What{3}brings you to my new home?{2}
Hamma...{2}
You're my sister... Why didn't{3}you tell me sooner? Why didn't{3}you tell me when we first met?{2}
You play an important role in{3}all this. If I'd told you, you{3}would have come here too soon.{2}
This place is so familiar...{3}I feel like I've lived here{3}my whole life.{2}
Look at me, {17}{3}.{2}
You're too sentimental.{1}You would have given up your{3}quest to find your true home,{3}and we would all now be lost.{2}
What are you saying, sister?{2}
No, not sister... Do not think of{3}me as your sister until you{3}have fulfilled your destiny.{2}
W-Why?{2}
Our world is falling{3}into ruin...{2}
What? Hamma, what do you{3}mean? What's happening?{2}
Look, I don't want to interrupt{3}your reunion or anything, but...{2}
I couldn't help overhearing{3}you say something about the{3}world falling apart. What's up?{2}
Our world requires a delicate{3}balance of elemental forces.{3}That balance has been disturbed.{2}
Without that balance, one{3}element might be lost beneath{3}the others, straining Weyard.{2}
You're talking about{3}Mars Lighthouse, right?{2}
Isn't Agatio taking care of{3}Mars Lighthouse? Everything{3}should be fine soon.{2}
Agatio will not light{3}Mars Lighthouse.{2}
You don't think he can do it?{2}
No. A great power stands{3}ready to oppose them.{2}
They lack the power to{3}resist that force, and they{3}will fall before it.{2}
But what will happen if{3}Mars Lighthouse isn't lit{3}quickly enough?{2}
Our world will be plunged{3}into ice.{2}
But what would make{3}that happen?{2}
Even I do not know the{3}answer to that question.{2}
Ah... Yes, given the way that{3}the elements interact, I see...{2}
Kraden, you understand?{2}
Well, I'm only guessing...{3}But I think it's a good guess.{2}
Quit fooling around and{3}tell me!{2}
The earth is nurturing and{3}warm. Many creatures are{3}reared in this warmth, you see?{30}
I follow you...{2}
It's OK, {17}{5}... I don't{3}really get it either, but let's{3}see where he's taking this...{2}
Now, think about the ocean.{3}It is a cold place, is it not?{30}
Yeah, it is awfully cold...{2}
I don't know what point he's{3}trying to make, but I have to{3}agree that the ocean's cold...{2}
Both lighthouses were lit,{3}and a balance was reached.{2}
But with only the lighthouse{3}of wind lit, the balance has{3}been disturbed.{2}
I get it... Wind cools things down,{3}but it can't heat them up...{2}
When you burn your hand on{3}something hot, you blow on{3}it to cool it off, don't you?{2}
Right, yeah... I've always done{3}that without thinking about{3}it, but it makes sense, huh?{2}
When Mercury Lighthouse was{3}lit, this didn't happen, though.{3}I wonder why...{2}
Water cannot cool things{3}as swiftly as wind, perhaps.{2}
Or maybe the combined power{3}of water and wind is cooling{3}things down even faster...{2}
If what Hamma's saying is{3}true, we'd better get moving{3}again, {17}{5}.{2}
I got too worked up about{3}seeing my sister... Sorry.{2}
It's all right. I'm happy that{3}you cared so much...{2}
All right, {17}{5}! Let's head{3}to Mars Lighthouse!{2}
No matter what happens, you{3}must light the beacon on{3}Mars Lighthouse!{1}I hope for your safe return.{2}
My heart is with you always,{3}{17}{3}. Never forget that.{2}
A cannon? Yeah, I think I heard{3}something about a town up in{3}western Angara having one...{1}A shot fired from that cannon{3}can apparently break even the{3}biggest blocks of ice.{2}
I'd sure like to see the cannon{3}someday. It sounds like a{3}powerful weapon...{2}
Now that the wings are finished,{3}I doubt anyone will be buying{3}any more armor from me.{2}
Well, if there aren't going to be{3}any customers for a while, maybe{3}I'll finally take that vacation.{2}
It's always such a letdown when{3}you finish off a major task like{3}fulfilling an ancient prophecy.{2}
Now that the wings are done,{3}everyone who came to help out{3}has left the village... {2}
All of our work and all of our{3}celebration are finally at an end.{1}I think Contigo is going to go{3}back to being a very quiet place.{2}
The inn has become so lonely{3}now that everyone's gone{3}home.{1}We should have an annual{3}festival in Contigo to{3}commemorate this day!{2}
Gosh... We were so busy,{3}and now we're totally empty.{3}I don't know what to do!{2}
Now's my chance to experiment{3}with some exciting new dishes!{3}What should I make first...{2}
It's going to be a little slow{3}for a while, but I can't really{3}complain, now, can I?{1}After all, I saw the lighthouse{3}shining again, and I actually{3}saw a flying ship!{2}
The inn is bound to be slow{3}for a little while, but business{3}will pick up again.{1}Everyone who witnessed the{3}events of the past few days{3}will want to come back.{2}
What are we going to do?{3}All the excitement is over,{3}and I'm going to be bored!{1}I was starting to like all the{3}attention I was getting!{2}
Seeing that ship take flight{3}was the most moving thing{3}I've ever seen...{1}I think I'll have to preserve{3}it for future generations...{3}in cake form!{2}
It was a miracle that made{3}all of the legends of the{3}Anemos come true...{1}I'm not entirely sure,{3}but I think my faith{3}has been restored!{2}
It was a shock to see{3}such a huge ship float.{1}It made me realize how{3}small we all truly are.{2}
I can't believe that a ship{3}just like the one in the{3}geoglyph actually exists.{1}And I think everyone's proud{3}to have helped to make the{3}legends come true!{2}
That flying ship looked so{3}fake... It didn't look anything{3}like I'd imagined it would.{1}Nobody else was complaining,{3}but they don't pay attention{3}to the details, like I do.{2}
Look closely at the{3}geoglyph. Study it,{3}examine its details...{1}The more you stare at it,{3}the more you recognize the{3}greatness of the Anemos.{2}
I'm convinced there's something{3}hidden in the Sanctum.{1}I just know it says something{3}about it on the wall.{2}
All the amazing things we've{3}seen and done, all the legends{3}that have come true...{1}And I still can't get into{3}the secret chambers of{3}the Anemos Sanctum!!!{2}
He's an odd boy, but I'm glad{3}that {17}{3} has returned{3}to Contigo at last...{2}
We all came together and{3}worked to make the legends{3}come true...{1}It's really inspiring... Actually,{3}it gives me goosebumps...{3}{9}{4}Brrrr...{7}{2}
All right, so we've followed{3}the instructions on the wall,{3}and we {9}{2}still{7} can't get in!{2}
If you tap on the floor or{3}walls, you can hear a hollow{3}sort of sound.{1}I'm convinced that there's{3}nothing on the other side!{2}
{17}{3} was supposed to be{3}a great, manly hero... I guess not{3}all the legends came true...{2}
I've been watching the skies,{3}hoping I could catch another{3}glimpse of the flying ship.{2}
I wonder what's on the other{3}side of the ocean... I should be{3}happy where I am, but...{1}Whenever I think about that{3}flying ship, I want to leave{3}home, to explore the world!{2}
All of our myths and legends{3}have taught us that the sea{3}is a dangerous, fearsome power.{1}But on the day the ship{3}left, the sea was so calm{3}and romantic looking...{2}
You're going north? I hear it's{3}always winter in the lands{3}to the north, so bundle up!{2}
Whenever I look at the sky,{3}I think about that flying ship,{3}and I want to travel the world.{2}
I wish I could travel to the{3}end of the sea on that{3}beautiful flying ship.{2}
Everyone in Contigo used{3}to be afraid of the ocean.{1}But now, everyone who saw the{3}ship take off sees the sea{3}filled with wonder and romance.{2}
I've decided to become...{3}an adventurer!{1}One day, when {17}{3} and his{3}companions return, I will join{3}them on their amazing ship!{2}
The legends tell us that a{3}great calamity brought an{3}end to the Anemos...{1}It had something to do with{3}the light from the lighthouses{3}being extinguished.{2}
That crater behind the village{3}is supposed to be where the{3}city of the Anemos was.{1}The legend says that, one day,{3}it just lifted off the ground and{3}flew away!{2}
The ancient city of the Anemos{3}was located right near the ruins.{1}That crater nearby is where{3}the city once was.{2}
Cities flying up into the{3}sky? I don't buy that for{3}a second!{2}
If a ship can rise up from{3}the sea, why can't a city{3}rise up from the ground?{2}
I've seen a lot of weird{3}things lately... Maybe I ought{3}to listen to those legends.{2}
The city of the Anemos rose up{3}into the sky and became what{3}we now call the Moon.{2}
Wait... The city of Anemos{3}flew up into the sky?{1}All right, that's just stupid!{2}
We did it! The ship took{3}off without a hitch!{2}
Yeah, but...shouldn't it be{3}flying a little higher than this?{2}
Hamma told us that we wouldn't{3}be able to fly very high until we{3}were more familiar with Hover.{2}
Let's see how far we{3}can take this thing!{2}
{17}{7}, what's wrong? You{3}don't look happy...{2}
Do you remember on Idejima,{3}when I told you I had my own{3}reasons for joining your quest?{2}
You were so secretive!{3}Are you going to tell us now?{2}
... ...{2}
You've gone quiet again...{5}{3}It's OK... You don't have to{3}tell us if you're not ready yet.{2}
I thought that if I went to{3}Jupiter Lighthouse, I would{3}learn who I was...{2}
I remember the people of{3}Lalivero talking about how{3}{17}{7} fell from the sky...{2}
All my life, I've been looking{3}for the answer... Where was I{3}born, and why was I abandoned?{2}
You knew {17}{5} was going to{3}Jupiter Lighthouse eventually,{3}and so you went along with him.{2}
But you didn't find any answers,{3}did you, {17}{7}?{2}
I'm sorry, {17}{7}... I was so{3}excited to find Contigo that I{3}didn't consider your feelings.{2}
What? Why is everyone so{3}down all of a sudden?{2}
... ...{2}
Faran raised {17}{7} like his own{3}daughter. He's cared for her{3}ever since he first found her!{2}
Yes, that's true, but...{2}
But you can never be his{3}real daughter, is that it?{2}
{17}{2}! You don't have to{3}be so blunt about it!{2}
No, he's right... I'd want to know{3}my real parents, no matter how{3}caring Faran might have been.{2}
You think so? If it were me, I{3}doubt it'd bother me at all...{2}
{17}{7}, you may not know this,{3}but you and I are very similar...{2}
What do you mean?{2}
Well, it's not exactly the{3}same situation, but...{2}
I was born in a poor village. My{3}memories are hazy, but I still{3}remember it.{2}
I was only four when Babi{3}took me under his wing.{2}
You see, even though I was{3}young, I was quite intelligent.{3}Babi had heard about me...{2}
And Babi took you to Tolbi{3}to further your education, to{3}raise you as a scholar...{2}
I was separated from my parents{3}so early in life... I've never known{3}the comforts of a true home.{2} 
Faran has always been like{3}a father to me... I must have{3}been very lucky.{2}
I should say so.{2}
Thank you, Kraden...{3}I feel better now...{2}
I'm glad I could help.{2}
Well, we should be going...{3}Let's hurry on, {17}{5}!{2}
Hey, wait!{2}
Master Hammet requested that{3}I deliver this to {17}{1}, and{3}I totally forgot about it!{2}
Well, you'd better hurry.{2}
I'm supposed to deliver this{3}to {17}{1}... It's not too late, is it?{2}
On my way here, I stopped in{3}Kalay briefly to speak with{3}Master Hammet.{2}
He was quite upset that you{3}hadn't returned to visit him{3}so that he could thank you.{2}
So he requested that I take{3}this with me to Atteka.{2}
It is a gift of thanks from{3}Master Hammet. Take it, please.{2}
Welcome to Loho! We've been{3}excavating all sorts of ores{3}to get the metals inside!{1}The metal used to make the{3}ancient ruins might have come{3}from these very rocks!{2}
We have a lot of important{3}excavations going on, but{3}we're also doing some mining.{2}
Some of the miners found an{3}ancient cannon when they{3}were digging a while back.{1}If you want to see it, it's{3}over by the wall near the{3}ruins.{2} 
That wall seems indestructible!{3}We've been trying to dig{3}through it for a while now.{1}We're pretty sure there are{3}some valuable metals and{3}minerals on the other side.{2}
We only settled here a short{3}while ago, and we found all{3}those ruins here...{1}We named our settlement{3}Loho, but I've been wondering{3}what it used to be called...{2}
Everyone in Loho sure loves{3}digging. It's not all mining...{3}We're interested in history, too.{2}
All we need is a way to use{3}the cannon to knock down the{3}wall... That would be great.{1}Then, we could get rid of the{3}cannon altogether. We don't{3}have any use for weapons here.{2}
If we can't get through that{3}wall, we'll never know what's{3}on the other side...{2}
Once we can get through the{3}wall, there will be enough{3}work for everyone in town!{2}
If you want to be a miner,{3}you have to know the earth...{3}You have to know where to dig.{2}
This is the spot. A good hole{3}here, and you'll dig up some{3}fantastic ore...{2}
I haven't found anything worth{3}the trouble of digging up. It's{3}time to find another spot.{2}
If you live in Loho and you{3}don't dig, you're not one of{3}us... You don't belong.{2}
Real experts can find the best{3}spots to dig in a single glance.{2}
Once you've been mining for{3}a while, it's like the ground says{3}to you, "Hey! Hey, you! Dig here!"{2}
I think I'm starting to lose{3}my touch... None of my digs{3}has produced anything at all.{2}
Commerce really took off{3}when we started this mining{3}colony in Loho.{1}You just have to know how{3}to make the most out of{3}what's around you...{2}
Whenever someone strikes{3}gold, we get a rush of visitors,{3}and business just takes off.{2}
If you're only here for{3}the cannon, you can{3}forget about it.{2}
If the cannon is truly as{3}powerful as the people say,{3}we can't just give it away.{2}
We brought the cannon up here{3}to break down the old wall, but{3}we don't have any ammunition...{2}
You can put metal balls in{3}the barrel, but what makes{3}them come out again?{1}It looks a little like an old{3}ballista, but the way it works{3}is totally different.{2}
Did you want this cannon?{30}
Well, if you can figure out{3}a way to break down this{3}wall, it's all yours.{2}
All we really want to do is{3}break down that wall right{3}there...{1}If we can find someone to do{3}that, we'll give 'im the cannon.{2}
Cannons are so heavy! Why did{3}we bring it up here if we're not{3}going to use it?{2}
What idiot said that we'd be{3}able to destroy that wall if{3}we dragged the cannon up here?{2}
All right, we figured out that{3}you need to put a steel ball in{3}there, but what do you do then?{1}You can stick a ball in there{3}just fine, but I don't think it'll{3}be coming out on its own...{2}
It looks like it's empty.{2}
This can't be used as{3}a cannonball.{2}
Is everyone all right?{2}
Did you hear that? That{3}sound was incredible!{2}
What do you think you're{3}doing, making all that noise?{2}
Hey, look at that!{2}
What are you looking at?{3}It wasn't me! It was the wall!{3}Look at the wall!{2}
The wall... It's gone!{2}
Well, it's mostly gone, yeah...{3}You can get through to the{3}other side now!{2}
How did you manage to{3}break down the wall?{2}
Ah, never mind... What's important{3}here is that we can dig on{3}the other side of the wall now!{2}
Yeah, who cares how it{3}happened? We can dig again!{2}
Well, you did what we asked,{3}so the cannon's all yours!{2}
Hmmm... It's gonna be tough{3}carrying that thing around...{2}
Those guys are new in town, aren't{3}they? Do you think they came{3}from Atteka or Hesperia?{2}
I don't know, but I can tell{3}you they came by boat...{2}
Yeah, I saw one anchored{3}off the beach!{2}
That boat's yours, isn't it?{30}
Well, why don't you let us{3}get that cannon onto your{3}boat for you, hm?{2}
Look, the only way to get{3}here is by boat, and I see{3}a boat right there!{1}Don't tell me it's not yours!{2}
I don't know why I'm offering,{3}but why don't you let us put{3}it aboard your boat for you?{2}
Was that you that fired{3}the cannon earlier?{1}If you know how to use{3}the cannon, you'll be able{3}to sail in the Northern Sea.{2}
That cannon sure gives off{3}a serious bang! Everyone in{3}Loho was totally shocked!{2}
When we found that cannon{3}at the dig, I thought it was{3}just useless junk.{1}If you know how to use{3}it, it can be a pretty{3}potent tool!{2}
Now that the wall's been{3}breached, we can get on{3}with the mining! Good work!{2}
That cannon can shatter any{3}of the ice floes that keep the{3}ships from trying to sail north.{2}
That cannon was really{3}loud... Imagine if you were{3}standing right next to it!{2}
I don't think we should have{3}given the cannon away. We{3}should have sold it to Tolbi.{2}
We don't have anything to worry{3}about, now that we can start{3}mining in the ruins...{2}
I've gotta go stake myself{3}a claim on the other side{3}of the wall!{1}We've found some valuable{3}metals out here; think what{3}we'll find inside!{2}
You probably only want the{3}cannon so that you can force{3}other people to obey your will.{2}
Ah, so you have a quest to{3}fulfill, do you? I guess that{3}means you're leaving soon.{1}When I was your age,{3}I used to love the life{3}of danger and adventure.{2}
I think we've dug up all{3}that there is out here.{1}I'm going to find myself{3}a new spot inside the wall.{2}
Thanks for opening up{3}the wall... There are some{3}great places to dig out here!{2}
I keep digging up little, tiny{3}gems and metals... But when I{3}get enough, I'll be rich!{1}After all, when you pile up{3}enough dirt, you eventually{3}make a mighty mountain!{2}
Ha ha ha! I've got this giddy{3}feeling, like I'm going to dig{3}up a mountain of money!{1}Whenever I get this feeling,{3}I always dig out a fortune!{2}
I just need to stick to this{3}one spot. Eventually, I'll{3}dig up something valuable!{2}
These guys must be really{3}busy, sailing around all over{3}the world like that.{2}
When they get wherever they're{3}going, they'll tell the world{3}that Loho's got the best metal!{2}
Even at my age, I just{3}love the feel of digging{3}into the earth.{1}Still, when you're not digging{3}up anything good, you start{3}to feel a little frustrated.{2}
I only just started digging,{3}and I'm already wealthy{3}beyond my wildest dreams!{2}
I've hit the mother lode!{3}I keep on digging, and I{3}keep getting more and more!{2}
It doesn't matter how old{3}you get... Nothing beats the{3}feeling of digging a new mine.{2}
I hear you took our cannon{3}in exchange for knocking{3}down that ancient wall.{1}I'll be sorry to see it go...{3}That cannon was going{3}to make Loho famous.{2}
Now, we don't have a symbol{3}anymore... We just have a{3}town full of holes.{2}
You've acquired a splendid{3}cannon. Just be sure that{3}you use it wisely.{2}
It worries me to no end,{3}thinking of the evils one{3}could do with that cannon.{2}
You don't have anything to{3}worry about. We got the cannon{3}onto your ship with no problems.{2}
Now, we're going to start{3}excavating the ground north of{3}the wall you knocked a hole in.{2}
I saw some of the village{3}men carrying the cannon{3}out of town...{2}
I don't know where they were{3}taking it, but I'm glad the{3}cannon's gone...{1}I think they just wanted to{3}make some room for us to{3}begin mining again.{2}
{16} checked the sign{1}It reads "People staying at{3}the inn can check in at the{3}counter.{2}
{17}{5}! Welcome back to{3}Prox! It looks like only Mars{3}Lighthouse still needs lighting...{1}Agatio didn't think you'd be{3}coming back here, so I'm a{3}little surprised to see you...{2}
Agatio and Karst left for{3}Mars Lighthouse a little{3}while ago...{2}
I'm glad you made it back{3}safely... The ice is making it very{3}difficult for anyone to sail here.{2}
We're used to the cold up{3}here in Prox, but lately, it{3}seems to be getting worse.{2}
I've been keeping a close{3}eye on the northern skies...{1}Once I see a bright flash in{3}the distance, I'll know the{3}last beacon has been lit.{2}
Have you seen Saturos or{3}Menardi? People have been{3}saying that they were killed...{2}
{17}{5}, you're back? And you{3}learned how to use Psynergy?{1}I can sense the power{3}inside of you... It's strong!{2}
Once the final lighthouse is lit,{3}the winds should weaken. They{3}keep getting stronger, though!{2}
Agatio and Karst told me that{3}{17}{5} ran away because{3}their quest was too dangerous.{2}
Agatio and Karst are the{3}strongest fighters in Prox...{3}That's why we sent them.{1}But I'm worried... They've been{3}gone for a while now, and the{3}lighthouse still remains dark.{2} 
Ever since Agatio returned from{3}Jupiter Lighthouse, the winds{3}have been stronger than ever...{2}
It gets cold around here, but{3}this is the first time I've ever{3}seen snow pile up on the river.{1}What if Agatio doesn't reach{3}Mars Lighthouse in time?{2}
Everything is supposed to{3}return to normal once Mars{3}Lighthouse is lit again.{2}
I can't believe anyone could{3}have beaten Saturos and{3}Menardi...{2}
If {17}{5} could become an{3}Adept so quickly, so can I!{2}
If this weather continues much{3}longer, we'll all be buried under{3}snow in no time.{2}
The rift at Mars Lighthouse{3}gets wider every day.{1}If we don't find a way to{3}stop it, I think it's going to{3}devour Prox entirely!{2}
Our chieftain told me that the{3}rift is growing larger by the day,{3}just like Gaia Falls is.{1}We'd better light the Mars{3}beacon soon, or Prox is{3}finished...{2}
Not too long ago, I climbed{3}the mountains to the north to{3}look at the rift. It was huge!{2}
I thought Prox would be here{3}forever, but now, it looks like{3}it might be destroyed!{2}
Nobody believed that the rift{3}would go as far south as{3}Prox...{1}They all thought Puelle was{3}being melodramatic... But no{3}one thinks that anymore...{2}
The northern rift has gotten{3}so big that I couldn't see the{3}other side...{2}
Prox originally flourished{3}because concerned Adepts lit{3}the fires of the Mars Lighthouse.{1}Now, we, the people of the{3}northern flame, have been{3}forgotten by the outside world.{2}
No one thought about our{3}needs when they extinguished{3}the great lighthouses...{1}Now, because of them, our{3}great land is dying, crumbling{3}away at the edges...{2}
If Mars Lighthouse's fires are{3}not rekindled, Prox will be{3}destroyed, but that's not all...{1}Eventually, Gaia Falls will{3}continue to erode, finally{3}devouring all of Weyard.{2}
When the lighthouses were{3}all extinguished, every great{3}civilization faded away...{2}
To think that we all once{3}had the power to control{3}nature... What fools we were.{2}
I think it's too late for us{3}already... But if they light the{3}fires, we'll be ready for them.{2}
We sent emissaries to Vale{3}to tell them that Weyard{3}was dying.{1}But they wouldn't listen to us...{3}If only they had listened to us...{2}
Vale's elders were stubborn...{3}They refused to listen to us,{3}and they drove us out by force.{1}We had gone in peace, hoping{3}to convince them of the plight{3}our world faces...{2}
At least the journey wasn't{3}for nothing. We learned that Sol{3}Sanctum held a hidden secret.{2}
Three years ago, we sent our{3}finest to Sol Sanctum. All but{3}two were killed in a trap.{1}The people of Vale couldn't{3}possibly understand how dire{3}our need was...{2}
{17}{5}, you like igloos, right?{2}
You {9}{2}would{7} say that...{3}You come from somewhere{3}warm and sunny!{1}We didn't have anything to{3}play with, so we just decided{3}to make this thing...{2}
Well, if you don't like cold{3}things, you're in the wrong{3}place!{1}We just built this so that{3}we'd have something to{3}do to keep us warm...{2}
The wind is so cold and{3}bitter that we decided to{3}hide out inside our igloo...{2}
My parents told me that it{3}would do me good to get some{3}fresh air, but I'm freezing!{2}
Those poor children. They{3}don't understand what's about{3}to happen to us...{1}I just want them to be happy{3}in the short time left to us.{2}
I hate igloos, but at least{3}it's protecting us from the{3}wind...{2}
Mama and Papa have been{3}acting really strange lately...{3}They seem so sad.{1}Whenever I ask them what's{3}wrong, they tell me to go{3}outside and play some more.{2}
I always catch a cold when I'm{3}outside in weather like this...{3}Does Mom want me to get sick?{2}
I can't bring myself to tell{3}them what's going to happen{3}to us...{5} Oh, please, save us...{2}
Puelle, our chieftain, grew{3}worried about Agatio and{3}Karst.{1}He's gone to the northern{3}edge of town to wait for them.{2}
The people Saturos rescued{3}from the storm in Vale should{3}be waiting in their room.{1}Once Mars Lighthouse has{3}been lit, they'll be free to{3}return home.{2}
Don't forget, {17}{5}, your{3}mother and father are staying{3}in the north end of Prox.{2}
Now that Saturos and his{3}team are gone, Agatio is the{3}last of our warriors.{1}If something happens to{3}them, our final hope is lost.{2}
Mars is the last lighthouse{3}that needs to be rekindled.{1}Once that's been taken care{3}of, the people of Vale will be{3}set free.{2}
Saturos used {17}{5}'s parents{3}to force {17}{5} to follow him{3}on his mission.{1}We've fallen on hard times{3}when we need to coerce{3}people to join our cause.{2}
They're not here...{2}
Strange... We looked all over{3}the village, and we can't find{3}any trace of them at all...{2}
Everyone says they've{3}practically vanished without{3}a trace... It's so strange.{2}
You don't think they...{2}
They wouldn't have gone to{3}the lighthouse...{2}
Yeah, you're probably right.{2}
Puelle's going to be upset{3}that we didn't follow his{3}order to free them, though.{2}
He was clear about it, too...{3}"When {17}{5} returns to Prox,{3}set his parents free."{2}
Puelle ordered me to set{3}your parents free. That's{3}why I'm here now...{1}The only thing is, no one{3}else is here... I don't know{3}where your parents went!{2}
{17}{5} took the trouble of{3}coming back for his parents,{3}and now they're just gone?{2}
Puelle wanted to set {17}{5}'s{3}parents free before Prox{3}was destroyed...{1}But if we can't find them,{3}how can we set them free?{2}
I can't think of anywhere{3}else {17}{5}'s parents{3}might have gone!{2}
When you left Prox, you were{3}so young that you could barely{3}lift a sword!{1}Now, look at you! You could{3}handle any weapon with ease!{2}
You go away for a little{3}while, and you come back{3}a strong and mighty warrior!{1}I'm so proud of you!{2}
What has he gone through{3}that he's become so strong{3}in such a short time?{2}
{17}{5} looks so confident,{3}so bold... You can see it in{3}his eyes...{2}
{17}{5}, your parents have{3}gone away... They were very{3}worried about you.{2}
Your mother knows that you're{3}strong and healthy, so I'm sure{3}she's very relieved...{2}
{17}{5}'s parents{3}were worried about him when{3}they heard Saturos was dead.{2}
{17}{5}'s parents were{3}so worried about him that{3}they were wasting away...{2}
I hear Agatio and Karst have{3}gone to Mars Lighthouse...{1}What if their actions only{3}cause more turmoil? How can{3}we be sure they're right?{2}
These catastrophes are{3}the result of the lighthouse{3}beacons being rekindled.{1}This snow, this wind, it all{3}started after Jupiter{3}Lighthouse was lit.{2}
We can't wait for Agatio{3}and his men any longer...{2}
If we wait much longer, this wind{3}and snow will make it impossible{3}to reach the lighthouse.{2}
I'm going to the lighthouse...{3}Will any of you come{3}with me?{2}
Puelle, I can't let you{3}go on your own...{2}
If something were to{3}happen to you, who{3}would lead our village?{2}
Please, you must let us{3}go in your stead.{2}
How can you expect to{3}accomplish what Agatio{3}and Karst could not?{2}
They may have been more{3}powerful than any of us, but{3}we can't just stand by!{2}
They're not coming back,{3}just like Saturos... You have{3}to let us try.{2}
I can't. I can't allow it.{2}
Listen to your elder...{3}He speaks wisely.{2}
I'm speaking to you too, Puelle.{2}
If Agatio and Karst cannot{3}do the task, how can you, a{3}single man, hope to do it?{2}
What are you saying?{3}If we stand around debating,{3}our town is doomed for certain!{2}
We can't risk sacrificing{3}any more lives.{2}
So, we must sit here and{3}wait for a miracle to come.{2}
Is that you, {17}{5}? When{3}did you return to Prox?{1}You should take your parents{3}back to Vale, so they can at{3}least die in their hometown.{2}
If we were better Adepts,{3}we could try to enter the{3}lighthouse ourselves...{2}
I feel so helpless... Agatio has{3}not returned, and the lighthouse{3}beacon remains unlit.{2}
All we can do now is wait{3}for Agatio and his men to{3}return...{1}But no honest soldier can{3}sit idly by while others do{3}all of the work.{2}
Our Psynergy feels weak...{3}I can sense it inside me.{1}The water, earth, and wind{3}lighthouses have been lit,{3}and fire alone remains dark.{2}
Puelle promised that he{3}would return our hostages{3}to Vale.{1}If you don't believe me,{3}ask him yourself.{2}
If the lighthouse isn't lit{3}soon, Prox is doomed...{3}I need to get out of here!{2}
Neither our elder nor Puelle{3}will tell us what's going on{3}at the lighthouse...{1}Why are we training so{3}much? A lighthouse shouldn't{3}pose that much danger...{2}
Puelle is stronger than any{3}of us, and there is nothing{3}he can do to save us...{1}But if we don't take some{3}kind of action, Prox will be{3}destroyed for sure...{2}
If they didn't light the beacon{3}and they didn't return home,{3}Agatio's team must have failed.{2}
If only my fire Psynergy{3}weren't so weak now, I{3}might be able to help...{2}
Puelle never intended to take{3}hostages. He wanted the people{3}of Vale to be returned safely.{1}Saturos insisted that we{3}hold on to them for our{3}safety, but Puelle disagreed.{2}
You... {17}{5}, it's you...{2}
I'd heard that you had returned{3}to us... You look so much{3}stronger than when you left.{2}
It seems he has brought{3}some allies with him.{2}
Yes... I am Kraden.{2}
My name is {17}{1}.{2}
{17}{1}... Isn't that...{2}
That is the name of the one{3}Agatio said had killed Saturos{3}and Menardi.{2}
{17}{1}, stop that...{2}
You are correct, but{3}{17}{1} had reasons{3}for fighting them.{2}
Saturos and Menardi had{3}invaded Vale, stolen its sacred{3}treasure, triggered a volcano...{2}
You cannot blame {17}{1} for{3}pursuing them and fighting{3}to regain what they had stolen.{2}
We only wanted to stop them...{3}We didn't think they'd fight{3}us to the death.{2}
They flung themselves into the{3}opening of Venus Lighthouse's{3}beacon...{2}
Did...Saturos and Menardi{3}put up a good fight?{2}
I'll bet you thought you{3}didn't stand a chance{3}against them, huh?{2}
You were probably really{3}tense the whole time...{2}
Saturos and Menardi had a{3}job to do... That was all.{2}
If I'd been in your shoes, I'd{3}have done the same thing...{3}I can't blame you.{2}
And in the end, you were stronger{3}than they were... You should be{3}proud of that.{2}
I am sad that they lost their{3}lives in their quest, but there{3}was no avoiding it.{2}
What has happened cannot{3}be undone. We should cooperate{3}to find a way to save Weyard.{2}
We understand that Agatio{3}and Karst have made for Mars{3}Lighthouse and not returned.{2}
Then all that remains for us{3}is to wait until Gaia Falls{3}carries us all to our doom.{2}
It seems that Mars Lighthouse{3}is as dangerous as all the rest.{2}
We have only a few soldiers{3}remaining, and none who can{3}make the climb to the aerie.{2}
Only Saturos and perhaps{3}Agatio were strong enough{3}to reach the top...{2}
And none of them can{3}help us now.{2}
You think we can do it?{30}
I agree, {17}{5}...{2}
{17}{5}, what are you{3}thinking?{2}
We've climbed three lighthouses{3}already... What's one more? Let's{3}go to Mars Lighthouse!{2}
They've proven themselves{3}strong enough! I say we trust{3}in {17}{5} to do this!{2}
This is an unexpected turn of{3}events, but yes, I think you{3}can light the lighthouse...{2}
Off to the Mars Lighthouse!{3}Let's go, {17}{5}!{3}Come on, {17}{1}!{2}
There is one thing that I{3}don't want you to forget.{2}
In order to light the beacon{3}at Mars Lighthouse, you will{3}need to have the Mars Star.{2}
Ah! And Agatio and Karst{3}have the Mars Star now!{2}
You must find Agatio and{3}Karst, and you must take{3}the Mars Star from them.{2}
Thanks for your help.{3}The future of Weyard{3}rests in your hands.{2}
You must find Karst,{3}get the Mars Star, and{3}light the lighthouse.{2}
{17}{5}, you are the only{3}hope left to us now.{3}Good luck.{2}
If this doesn't work, we're all{3}finished... Prox, Weyard, even{3}Vale... All will be lost...{2}
If they were strong enough to{3}defeat Saturos and Menardi,{3}perhaps they can do the job...{2}
Why... Why am I lying here?{2}
Wait, I think I remember... We{3}were going to light the beacon...{2}
But the lighthouse was frozen.{3}We wandered lost inside,{3}trying to find the aerie...{2}
We must hurry... If we{3}delay, Prox is destroyed.{2}
It's no use... I'm absolutely{3}drained... I can't even stand.{2}
And the cold... Why am I so cold?{3}We of the Fire Clan are meant{3}to be immune to the cold...{2}
I feel the cold too, Karst...{3}I... I'm afraid we're going{3}to die up here...{2}
I can feel it now... The long,{3}dark sleep creeping into{3}my soul...{2}
Wait... I think{3}I remember...{2}
The eye... It told us that we{3}lack the will to go any farther.{2}
The eye... I remember now...{3}I felt its gaze pierce me to{3}the core, then all went black...{2} 
That's right... And I remember{3}fighting against {17}{5}...{2}
I do, too... Was it a dream?{3}An illusion?{2}
{17}{5}? Is that you?{30}
Amazing... Then our luck hasn't{3}entirely run out yet...{2}
How can you play games{3}with us like this?{1}Regardless, it's amazing that{3}you're here... It means our luck{3}hasn't entirely run out yet...{2}
{17}{5}, you must complete{3}our quest... Please... You have{3}to light the beacon...{2}
We can't even stand... We're in{3}no condition to go on. Light{3}the beacon for us... Please.{2}
You'll need the Mars Star.{3}Go on... Take it.{2}
Please hurry... If I can just see{3}the light of the beacon, I'll know{3}that I haven't died in vain.{2}
We're counting on you...{2}
It's too late for us now...{3}Hurry, light the beacon.{2}
Your hand...so warm...{3}People have such warm{3}hands... I had forgotten...{2}
I'm so tired... A fog is rising{3}before my eyes... No! Can't{3}die until the beacon...is lit...{2}
I'm so cold, colder than I ever{3}thought possible... All because{3}Mars Lighthouse remains unlit...{1}I have to stay alive...long{3}enough to see its light...{2}
You who hold the star,{3}open your heart and listen...{1}If you wish to reach the heavens,{3}give your star to me.{2}
If you do not hold the star,{3}you shall not ascend to the{3}heavens... Begone!{2}
You who hold the star,{3}open your heart and listen...{2}
If you wish to scale the{3}heavens, set the four{3}spirits aflame!{2}
Mankind... With the power of{3}wisdom, they ruled the earth.{2}
Fish... With cold courage,{3}they ruled the water.{2}
Dragons... Burning with might,{3}they ruled the fires.{2}
Bird... On the wings of truth,{3}they ruled the winds.{2}
You have proven your worth!{3}The heavens await you!{2}
Betrayers, you have arrived!{2}
Who said that!?{2}
The wind's too strong!{3}I can't see anything!{2}
I heard it too, but I don't{3}see anyone else up here!{2}
{17}{5}! Quick! Cast the Mars{3}Star in before anything{3}has a chance to stop us!{2}
So, you are still intent on lighting{3}the beacon of Mars Lighthouse?{2}
Who said that!?{2}
Have you forgotten me so soon,{3}{17}{1}? And you, {17}{2}?{2}
It seems to know you,{3}{17}{1}... Do you have any{3}idea what it is?{2}
Then search your heart, boy!{2}
That voice...{2}
It's...the Wise One!{2}
{17}{1}, since when are{3}you on a first-name basis{3}with the Wise One?{2}
It must have been{5}.{5}.{5}. {17}{1},{3}what happened in Sol Sanctum{3}after we were kidnapped?{2}
When Saturos and Menardi stole{3}the Elemental Stars, they also{3}triggered a volcanic eruption.{1}The Wise One prevented Mt. Aleph{3}from erupting so that {17}{2}{3}and I could escape.{2}
But...wait, Mt. Aleph {9}{2}did{7} erupt!{3}There was a huge explosion! We{3}saw it all the way in Vault!{2}
But it would have erupted with{3}us still inside... There was no way{3}we could have escaped in time.{2}
The Wise One held off the{3}eruption until we could escape...{3}He even halted the lava flow.{2}
I can't believe it... Nobody has{3}enough power to do that...{2}
I know it sounds weird, but I{3}was there, and it happened, so{3}you'll just have to believe us!{2}
If it can do all that, this{3}Wise One seems more like{3}a god than an Adept!{2}
I did not just save you. I also{3}tasked you with recovering the{3}four Elemental Stars.{2}
Why have you disobeyed my{3}command? Why have you come{3}to light the beacon?{2}
Because Prox will be{3}destroyed if we don't! We{3}can't let that happen...{2}
Prox? They have brought this{3}disaster upon themselves.{2}
Are you saying we should just{3}abandon them to die? What{3}did they do to deserve that!?{2}
The people of Prox have{3}committed an unforgivable{3}sin. They must pay the price.{2}
For lighting the lighthouses?{3}Is that their sin? Does that{3}warrant total destruction?{2}
If we don't light the beacon,{3}Gaia Falls will eventually{3}erode away all of Weyard!{2}
We have fought for so long to{3}save all the people of our world,{3}and now you would stop us?{2}
Gaia Falls is growing.{3}It's consuming more and{3}more with each passing day!{2}
How can you just allow{3}the world to crumble into{3}nothingness?{2}
The seal needs to be{3}broken! The world will be{3}destroyed if it's not!{2}
You have learned{3}far too much.{2}
Wise One! You can't continue{3}to protect the lighthouses! You{3}know what's happening!{2}
It is your duty to protect all of{3}Weyard! If Weyard is destroyed,{3}you will have failed us all!{2}
Why won't you answer{3}us, Wise One?{2}
If Alchemy is unleashed,{3}mankind may well destroy{3}all of Weyard itself.{2}
But we can combine our{3}strengths, ensure that Alchemy{3}not be used for evil...{2}
It is inevitable. In time, one man{3}will seek to rule over all. It is{3}human nature, inescapable.{2}
And it shall come sooner{3}than any of you think.{2}
Why do you say that?{2}
The Water Adept who climbs{3}toward the peak of Mt. Aleph{3}even as we speak...{1}Is he not a friend of yours?{2}
Alex is his name. Surely,{3}you have not forgotten him?{2}
Alex!? What would he be{3}doing on Mt. Aleph?{2}
He understands far more than{3}you do. He knows that when{3}the four beacons have been lit...{1}Their light will gather{3}at Sol Sanctum.{2}
But what would he gain{3}from being there?{2}
When the final beam of light{3}reaches the peak of Mt. Aleph,{3}the Golden Sun shall rise.{2}
The Golden Sun!?{3}What is that? And what{3}would Alex want with it?{2}
When the four beams merge{3}into one, they form a golden{3}light, bathing Mt. Aleph's peak.{2}
Is... Is that Alchemy? I mean,{3}pure Alchemy made real, at{3}the heart of its power?{2}
And it's that light that gives{3}shape to the Stone of Sages?{2}
This has been Alex's one true{3}desire from the very start.{2}
Alex planned all of this?{3}Then he must have been{3}after this power all along!{2}
We've been duped! He used us all!{3}Oh, you'd better believe he's{3}not getting away with this!{2}
Alex... How could he do this?{3}He's... He's one of my own{3}people! I feel sick...disgusted...{2}
None of that matters right now.{3}We still have to light the beacon.{3}We don't have any choice.{2}
If we don't do it now, Prox{3}will be destroyed!{3}{17}{5}... We have to, right?{30}
You bet we do! The Wise One{3}will have to deal with Alex{3}on his own.{2}
{17}{5}! We don't have any{3}choice! The Wise One will have{3}to deal with Alex himself.{2}
I cannot interfere in the{3}actions of mankind.{2}
If you can't interfere, then how{3}about getting out of our way so{3}we can light the beacon, huh?{2}
Ooo... Good one, {17}{6}!{2}
I don't like doing exactly what{3}Alex wants, but it's looking like{3}we've got no choice...{2}
Don't worry, {17}{5}!{3}Just throw the Mars Star into{3}the beacon's well! Now!{30}
The Wise One himself said{3}he's not allowed to interfere!{3}You're all clear!{2}
Wise One! Didn't you just say{3}that you aren't allowed to{3}interfere with our actions?{2}
That is correct.{3}I cannot stop you.{2}
But...what if some miracle were{3}to occur, one that prevented you{3}from igniting the beacon?{2}
Miracle? What are you talking{3}about? What kind of miracle?{2}
If you can defeat a miracle,{3}only then can you ignite the{3}beacon's flame.{2}
The Wise One is up to something!{3}Be wary, everyone! We don't{3}know what he's capable of!{2}
A three-headed dragon?{3}{9}{2}That's{7} your miracle?{2}
So you would have us fight{3}for our future? Fine, then{3}fight we shall!{2}
What's he thinking? We already{3}beat a two-headed dragon. How{3}much tougher can this one be?{2}
I don't care how many heads{3}it has. Nothing's going to{3}stop us now!{2}
Let's do it! For Prox!{3}For the future of Weyard!{2}
Wait a second... Wasn't that{3}two-headed dragon actually{5}.{5}.{5}.{1}So that means this three-{3}headed dragon must be...{2}
{17}{5}! NO! You mustn't{3}fight that dragon! It's{176}{2}
Too late, Kraden! We can't{3}get away from it now!{2}
{17}{5}, don't! Stop!!!{2}
...Who are they?{2}
That's what I was trying{3}to warn you about!{2}
It wasn't just the dragon{3}you killed...{2}
I remember you warning us,{3}but it was too late for us to{3}stop...{2}
Kraden, what do you know?{3}Why were you trying to stop{3}us from fighting the dragon?{2}
It was the Wise One's{3}final trap...{2}
Trap? What do you mean?{2}
The Wise One knew he couldn't{3}stop you, so he played a cruel,{3}wretched trick on you instead.{2}
Kraden, I don't understand...{3}What are you trying to tell us?{2}
{17}{7}, let's see who{3}those people are while they{3}try to sort this out.{2}
No, {17}{6}! Don't look!{3}You mustn't look! It will only{3}bring you pain...{2}
What are you talking about,{3}Kraden? They can't hurt us{3}anymore... We'll just{176}{2}
What's the matter, {17}{6}?{2}
It...can't be... How? How...{2}
Nnn... Uhnnn...{2}
What is it, {17}{1}?{2}
Uhhh...unnnn...{2}
{17}{1}! I... I know{3}that guy! That's your dad!{2}
Then...does that mean...{3}the other two are...{2}
Hhnnnng...{2}
Hhhnnn...{2}
Mom... Dad...{2}
I'll heal {17}{6}'s parents!{3}Quickly, {17}{4}! Tend to{3}{17}{1}'s father!{2}
If only... If only I'd realized{3}it sooner...{2}
What's the matter, {17}{8}?{3}Why did you stop? {17}{6}'s{3}parents need you...{2}
Don't give up, {17}{4}. You{3}can't! You have to save them...{2}
It's no use, {17}{3}...{3}I'm tapped...{2}
I am, too... And even if I weren't,{5}{3}it's just too late...{2}
What are you saying!?{2}
They're not...{3}They can't be...{2}
That's not what I'm saying,{3}{17}{6}... I...{2}
I finally found them... I was{3}going to be with them again...{3}For the first time in years...{2}
{17}{6}...{2}
Please... It can't be...{2}
Mom... Wake up!{3}It's me... It's {17}{6}!{3}...Don't leave me...{2}
{17}{6}, you must prepare{3}yourself for what comes next...{2}
Being transformed into a dragon,{3}fighting in that form... This{3}requires tremendous power.{2}
What are you saying, Kraden?{2}
In fighting you, your parents{3}were forced to use every{3}last ounce of their energy.{2}
They don't have the strength to...{2}
Even if they had won the battle,{3}they would not have survived.{3}You cannot blame yourself...{2}
You monster!!!{2}
Why did you do this? Why{3}did you make us fight{3}{17}{6}'s parents?{2}
You're no god! You're no{3}protector! You're evil!{2}
You don't understand the pain{3}you have caused, Wise One.{2}
You have no idea the damage{3}done to a child who learns she{3}has destroyed her own parents.{2}
That's enough...{2}
I knew what I was doing the{3}moment I raised my sword.{2}
We defied the Wise One in{3}order to save the world.{3}Our parents would understand.{2}
Don't you think so, {17}{5}?{30}
You're right. It hurts, but it's true.{3}We didn't do this for ourselves.{3}We did it for all of Weyard.{2}
I agree with my brother...{3}But it does no one any good{3}if we don't complete our task.{2}
We still have a chance to{3}save Prox.{2}
Perhaps we can't save your{3}parents, but we can save{3}countless others.{2}
Kyle and the others saved{3}them, too... They sacrificed their{3}lives so that we could go on.{2}
I never imagined that{3}my actions would help{3}to save the world...{2}
Even though lighting the beacon{3}may create wars and strife,{3}I regret none of this.{2}
There's little time left, {17}{5}...{3}Use the Mars Star and{3}light the beacon.{2}
Our quest is almost over.{3}I...don't know how I'm going{3}to tell Mom about this...{1}But sorrow can wait. We've{3}got to light the beacon.{2}
I wish I could console you{3}somehow... It must be tough...{1}I just wish I'd had one last{3}chance to have some of{3}{17}{5}'s mother's cookies.{2}
{17}{5}, I understand your{3}loss...{1}But remember, you and {17}{6}{3}still have each other.{2}
If Alex set this all in motion,{3}then he's responsible for this,{3}and I'll never forgive him.{2}
I thought I'd get to see my{3}parents again... I thought I'd{3}get to hold them again...{1}But instead, we were{3}forced to destroy them...{2}
I don't know my parents...{3}They might be alive, somewhere{3}out there... But I share your pain.{2}
I'm sorry things had to end{3}up like this, {17}{6}.{2}
Both Kyle and your parents{3}were very dear to me. My{3}sorrow joins yours, friends.{1}We must light the beacon, if for{3}no other reason than to provide{3}them with a proper funeral.{2}
Unnnn... {17}{5}?{3}...{17}{6}?{1}I am so happy...to have one{3}last chance to see you again...{3}in the end...{2}
Uhhhhnnn... {17}{5}...{3}I...can't see you, but I sense that{3}you're nearby...{1}Please... Take care of{3}{17}{6} for us...{2}
*Koff! Koff!* {17}{5}...{3}You made it back...alive...{3}Please, I must ask one last thing...{1}Tell Dora...to live her life{3}to the fullest...for me...{2}
Do not let your sadness{3}overwhelm you, {17}{5}!{1}Go! Once the beacon has been{3}ignited, you can mourn as much{3}as you need. I will protect you.{2}
Will you cast in the Mars Star?{30}
The beacon is lit!{2}
And to think, I joined this quest{3}hoping to prevent exactly this{3}from happening...{2}
And I began this quest as a{3}prisoner, taken against my will.{2}
And if that tidal wave hadn't{3}sent me far off course, I{3}wouldn't even be here now.{2}
How many lives have been{3}taken and changed forever{3}just to light this beacon?{2}
Mom... Dad...{3}Weyard is safe now.{2}
You're right!{3}I hear voices, too!{2}
I told you...{3}I told you I could hear them!{2}
Who said that?{3}Where are you?!{2}
We're in Imil! We're at the{3}base of Mercury Lighthouse!{2}
You... You can't be!{2}
You... You can't be!{2}
Hey! I know that voice!{3}It's {17}{4}, I just{3}know it!{5} {17}{4}!!!{2}
It's you!{2}
Of course it's us! We can hear{3}you, {17}{4}! You're all{3}right! I'm so happy!{2}
Who are those two{3}kids talking to?{2}
I don't know. They've been{3}standing here telling everyone{3}to leave the lighthouse.{1}...Weird couple of kids{3}if you ask me!{2}
How is it that we{3}can hear you?{2}
I don't know, but he told us{3}we'd be able to talk to you{3}if we came here now.{2}
He? Who's "he"?{2}
I don't know... We were sleeping,{3}and he came to us in a dream...{1}He said, "Go to the lighthouse!"{2}
The lighthouse? Why?{2}
He said that we have to{3}deliver a message... He was{3}too busy to do it himself...{2}
What message?{2}
We have to warn everyone to{3}stay clear of the lighthouses!{2}
What's going to happen?{2}
I don't know, but he told us{3}to warn people away from{3}Mt. Aleph as well!{2}
But who is "he"!? You{3}still haven't told us!!!{2}
You're a meanie! I don't{3}tell meanies anything!{2}
Don't pay any attention to{3}him... It's me, {17}{4}... Can you{3}tell me who spoke to you?{2}
I told you, I don't know, but{3}he looked like a big rock...{3}with a big, rocky eye!{2}
The... The Wise One!{2}
What could he be doing?{2}
Of course! I understand...{2}
The Wise One said that when{3}all four lighthouses have been{3}lit, the Golden Sun will shine...{2}
When that happens, Mt. Aleph{3}and the lighthouses will probably{3}become quite dangerous...{2}
So, the Wise One is warning{3}people in dreams, telling{3}them to seek refuge?{2}
Why would he do that!? You{3}saw what he did to us... He{3}can't be up to anything good...{2}
Have you not learned?{3}One's actions do not always{3}reveal one's true intentions.{2}
Hamma...{5} Sister...{2}
Master Hamma! Did you receive{3}a message, too?{2}
Yes. I was called to Jupiter{3}Lighthouse in a dream.{2}
You have completed your{3}quest, but I see it comes{3}with great loss...{1}Your suffering has been{3}almost unbearable.{2}
Master Hamma... My parents...{2}
I know, {17}{6}, and I am sorry.{3}But do not give up hope{3}for them just yet...{2}
What do you mean,{3}Master Hamma?{2}
Appearances can be an{3}illusion... The Wise One{3}has a caring heart.{2}
He forced us to fight{3}{17}{1}'s and {17}{6}'s parents!{3}What's so "caring" about that!?{2}
If the Wise One were truly evil,{3}he would not be warning me{3}of danger in my dreams.{2}
Well, I... I guess not... But{3}then, what's he up to?{2}
We do not have time to{3}discuss it right now.{2}
She's right.{1}If the Wise One said it's not{3}safe to be near the lighthouses,{3}then I think we should listen.{2}
I am heading for safety, too.{3}All of you must get away{3}from the lighthouse now.{2}
Hurry, everyone! Let's go!{2}
What about our parents?{2}
We can't leave them behind...{2}
I understand how you feel, but{3}we won't make it if we have{3}to take them with us!{2}
Make the decision, {17}{5}!{3}Should we take them with us?{30}
It's too dangerous...{3}The Golden Sun is forming!{2}
A ray of light is emanating{3}from the beacon... From the{3}Mars Star.{2}
What will happen?{2}
The power of Alchemy will{3}be unleashed upon the world!{2}
We must take {17}{1}'s{3}father and {17}{6}'s{3}parents and flee!{2}
Stop it! Let go of my wrist!{2}
{17}{2}, get a grip!{3}No one's touching you!{2}
I'm serious! I...{2}
The beacon!{2}
{17}{6}... We have to{3}move your parents!{2}
Mom! Dad!{2}
What's happening?{2}
There's no time for questions!{3}Just carry them!{3}Carry them and go!{2}
There's a space for you{3}to place something.{2}
{17}{5} got the Mars Star!{2}
{17}{5} used the Mars Star!{2}
{16} checked the ice.{1}
A shaft of ice is poking{3}up through the floor.{2}
Thank you, {17}{5}.{3}And you, too, {17}{1}{3}and Kraden.{2}
By igniting Mars Lighthouse,{3}you stopped Gaia Falls{3}from devouring our town.{2}
We're just glad to have helped{3}save Weyard...{2}
You've been through many{3}trials, more than any of us{3}can ever know...{2}
We had no idea what to{3}expect when we lit the{3}final beacon...{2}
When we saw the flash of{3}the beacon, we had no idea{3}what you suffered to light it...{2}
I thought we were done for...{3}There was no way we could{3}escape with our parents' bodies.{2}
Well, at least, not if we hadn't{3}pulled together and overcome{3}our sorrows...{2}
That light was brilliant!{2}
You know, I shall always regret{3}that I didn't get to look upon{3}the beacon's light from afar...{2}
I understand your regret... As{3}a scholar of Alchemy, you would{3}have been most impressed.{2}
I saw the beams of blue, red,{3}and purple streaming out{3}toward the southeast...{2}
That's the direction in which{3}Vale lies, is it not? Was the{3}light headed to your hometown?{2}
Indeed it was. The Wise One{3}said the beams were going to{3}merge into one above Mt. Aleph.{2}
The orb of golden light{3}we saw... That was shining{3}directly over Vale?{2}
Yes. That was the Golden{3}Sun forming over Mt. Aleph.{2}
If I remember the{3}tales correctly...{1}The Golden Sun is the blast of{3}light emitted at the very moment{3}the Stone of Sages forms...{2}
Such legends exist even{3}here? I wish that I'd known{3}that sooner!{2}
I fear for Vale, to think that all{3}this energy is being released{3}right over your hometown.{2}
We're all worried about that.{3}We're hoping we can return to{3}Vale as quickly as possible.{2}
Oh... Is there nothing we can{3}do to convince you to stay?{2}
We had hoped you might stay{3}in Prox a while, but that sounds{3}unlikely...{2}
Don't worry... We plan on{3}returning as soon as things{3}quiet down, don't we?{30}
Our village will not soon forget{3}that you saved us from the edge{3}of destruction. Do visit us again.{2}
You have just completed a{3}long and difficult journey.{1}Perhaps when you are older,{3}and you look back on your youth,{3}you will remember us fondly...{2}
When that time comes, I may{3}no longer be in this world.{2}
Don't say such things... I'm{3}sure a long life awaits you.{2}
Well, I suppose we should{3}be departing for Vale soon.{2}
You're right, Kraden...{3}If we don't, you-know-who{3}might start causing trouble...{2}
At least some of your cares{3}have been remedied...{1}You must be glad to know{3}we've brought all three{3}back from the brink of death.{2}
I would not have thought it{3}possible had I not seen it.{2}
Even I do not fully{3}understand it...{2}
But their can be no doubt. The{3}fire Psynergy released by the{3}beacon rekindled their spirits.{2}
I hadn't expected so much{3}Psynergy to be released by{3}the lighthouse's beam...{2}
I have no real explanation,{3}other than that their life force{3}had not been fully extinguished.{1}It was a miracle, but the{3}fire Psynergy seems to have{3}recharged them somehow.{2}
And had your parents not been{3}Adepts, the wave of Psynergy{3}would have passed them by.{2}
{17}{1}! What's taking you{3}two so long? Don't keep me{3}waiting!{2}
Uh-oh! It's {17}{6}...{3}We're late, and she looks{3}rather displeased with us.{2}
Should I let her know{3}we're leaving now?{30}
I'm sorry! We're almost done.{3}Can you wait for us at the{3}village gates with the others?{2}
I'm serious! If I have to wait{3}much longer, you're not{3}going to be happy!{2}
I'm sorry, {17}{6}! It sounds{3}like things are going to take{3}just a little bit longer...{2}
Well, I'm not going to wait much{3}longer! If you don't come soon,{3}we're all leaving without you!{2}
I'll wait outside with them.{2}
I don't think they want to{3}wait anymore, {17}{5}.{3}We're all set to head home...{2}
They have no patience{3}whatsoever. Ah, well...{3}I suppose it is time to leave.{2}
May your journey home{3}be safe and uneventful...{2}
We shall never forget what{3}you have done for Prox.{2}
Thank you for lighting the{3}fires of the lighthouse beacon,{3}{17}{5}. You saved us all.{2}
It's too bad about Agatio{3}and Karst...{1}They weren't bad people... A{3}little obsessed, yeah, but it's{3}still sad that they're gone.{2}
I don't remember the last{3}time I saw the sky this bright{3}and clear. It feels wonderful!{2}
Winter in Prox can be bitter{3}cold, but I think things will{3}feel more mild after this.{2}
I was so moved when I saw{3}that light shining from the{3}north. We all owe you our lives.{2}
The lighthouses have all been{3}lit... Does that mean we're going{3}to fall back into war and chaos?{2}
You did an amazing job... You{3}accomplished what Agatio and{3}Karst could not...{2}
Will you be going back to Vale{3}now that your quest is over,{3}{17}{5}? Don't forget us!{2}
{17}{5} has proven{3}himself as the strongest{3}warrior Prox has ever known!{2}
I heard the Karst and Agatio{3}were defeated by a monstrous{3}dragon...{1}{17}{5} beat the dragon,{3}though... I don't know whether{3}I'm impressed or scared of him.{2}
The blizzard's finally over...{3}That was the worst patch of{3}weather we've ever had!{2}
Now that our weather is{3}returning to normal, maybe{3}everyone will move back here.{2}
I was the first person in town{3}to see the lighthouse! I was{3}so happy, I had to tell everyone!{1}I felt like a little boy again,{3}running giddily through{3}town, shouting and waving!{2}
They had no choice... They{3}had to light the four{3}elemental lighthouses...{1}Even though it might mean{3}a rise in war and violence,{3}it had to be done.{2}
When {17}{5} left town, he{3}of a fighter... He wasn't much{3}of anything, really...{1}When did he become{3}mightier than the mightiest{3}of Prox's warriors?{2}
I bet {17}{5} and his friends{3}live in a nice, warm place... I{3}wish I could go with them.{2}
I think the rift to the north{3}started receding when the{3}lighthouse was lit...{2}
I wonder if that hole up{3}north has stopped growing...{3}What if it starts again?{2}
The lighthouse was so beautiful{3}when the beacon was lit... It{3}made a beautiful band of light!{2}
I was afraid the falls were{3}going to gobble me up!{3}I'm glad that's over now...{2}
What do we do if the falls{3}start expanding again and{3}{17}{5} isn't here?{1}Oh, great... That's going to{3}keep me up all night worrying.{2}
All the lights joined up{3}together and shot off to{3}the southeast.{1}It looked like they all{3}formed into a big, golden{3}ball or something.{2}
I've been told that lighting{3}the four beacons has set{3}Alchemy free on the world.{1}Now that we all can use{3}Alchemy again, civilization is{3}going to make great strides!{2}
I guess the four lighthouses{3}were the seal that blocked{3}the power of Alchemy.{1}So not only did {17}{5} save{3}Prox, he's also brought{3}about a new golden age!{2}
The people of Prox won't{3}forget what you've done{3}for them...{1}You can return home to{3}Vale with great pride, but you'll{3}always be welcome here.{2}
Alchemy has been freed. We{3}must begin researching it{3}in earnest here in Prox.{2}
Now that Alchemy is free,{3}it's like Weyard is waking up!{3}How will the world change?{2}
{17}{5} and his allies{3}saved us from certain{3}destruction.{1}It's a shame the rest of the{3}world doesn't know how much{3}they've done for us all.{2}
{17}{5}, take some advice{3}from an old man...{1}You would do well not to tell{3}anyone that you were the ones{3}to light the beacons...{2}
{17}{1} and his friends left{3}Vale having sworn to return{3}with the Elemental Stars.{1}When they return, they'll have{3}to tell everyone what happened.{3}I hope they won't be punished...{2}
If they found out {17}{5} used{3}the treasures of Sol Sanctum{3}to light the beacons...{1}That fool of a mayor would{3}no doubt punish them for{3}what they did to save us.{2}
The mayor and the elders in{3}Vale are so out of touch.{1}When they see {17}{5} and{3}his friends return without the{3}stones, they'll punish them.{2}
Weeee! What fun! Now that{3}it's stopped snowing, we{3}can go outside and play.{2}
I miss running around outside.{3}It's been so cold, I can't even{3}work up a good sweat.{2}
If I'm going to be a great{3}warrior, like {17}{5}, I'm gonna{3}have to train hard.{2}
I can hear the sound of{3}children playing far off{3}in the distance...{1}That sound means that{3}everything's back to normal{3}and our worries are past.{2}
Now that the lighthouse is lit,{3}we don't have to play in{3}that stupid igloo anymore.{2}
That blizzard was unreal,{3}but it's gone now, and the{3}weather's beautiful.{2}
You get more exercise running{3}in the snow, because it's a lot{3}harder to do.{2}
It's been so long since{3}children's voices rang{3}through our streets.{1}I hope these children{3}remain ignorant of how much{3}danger we were all in...{2}
I have much to do, so I{3}won't be able to see you{3}off, but I wish you safe journey.{2}
Your body has absorbed a{3}great deal of raw elemental{3}energy. Please be careful.{2}
There's no telling what could{3}happen now... If you absorbed{3}energy, maybe {17}{6} did, too...{1}Which means you'd better{3}not make her angry, or you'll{3}really get it!{2}
{17}{5}, I always thought{3}of you as my very own grandson{3}when you were here...{1}Now that you're leaving, I can't{3}describe the sorrow that fills{3}this old man's heart.{2}
Think of your old grandma's{3}cooking every now and then{3}when you're back home in Vale.{2}
We may have underestimated{3}the power of the Psynergy he{3}unleashed...{1}We'll have to study it more{3}closely once we've seen{3}{17}{5} on his way.{2}
The power to revive the dead...{3}It's an awesome and terrifying{3}power indeed...{1}Eternal life could soon be in{3}the hands of Alchemists{3}everywhere... What a thought!{2}
We've lost so many soldiers,{3}and now {17}{5} is leaving...{3}It's going to be quiet in Prox.{2}
Who knew that the poor, injured{3}boy they brought back from Vale{3}would be the one to save Prox?{1}I'm happy that he'll finally{3}be able to return home, but{3}I'll miss him so...{2}
I'm so sad... {17}{5} doesn't{3}even have time to enjoy{3}this last meal I made him...{2}
Thank you so much, {17}{5}!{3}If you hadn't returned to us,{3}we wouldn't be here now!{2}
Your foster grandmother knew{3}that you would return. She{3}always said you were reliable.{2}
I never imagined that little{3}{17}{5} would become stronger{3}even than Agatio and Karst.{2}
It's too bad {17}{5} can't{3}stick around... He'd make the{3}perfect son-in-law.{2}
We had no idea there would{3}be such a terrible earthquake{3}when the beacon was lit.{1}My wife tumbled right into my{3}arms... It was like we were{3}teenagers all over again!{2}
After that earthquake, I feel{3}like I aged a couple of years{3}in just a few minutes!{2}
We'll never be able to thank{3}{17}{5} and the warriors{3}of Vale enough.{1}I hope they're all happy to{3}be home with their families{3}in Vale again.{2}
When the earthquake hit,{3}{17}{5} and his friends{3}were high up on the lighthouse.{1}If that had been me up there,{3}I think my heart would have{3}stopped from fear!{2}
Now that the lighthouse has{3}been lit, I fear for what will{3}happen to Weyard.{2}
The lighthouses are going{3}to restore the power of{3}Alchemy to the land...{1}But Alchemy is too terrible{3}a power to set free...{2}
Sorry, {17}{5}, but this road{3}is blocked off right now.{2}
If you're worried about the{3}lighthouse beacon, don't...{3}It's still lit.{2}
I just don't think I'm cut out{3}to be a soldier. I should have{3}taken up knitting instead.{2}
{17}{5} taught me a lot{3}about how to be a serious{3}soldier...{1}I've been going easy on myself,{3}but no more! I'm going to train{3}harder every day!{2}
Even just standing outside the{3}lighthouse, I can feel the energy{3}coming from within...{2}
Well, you look like you're all{3}set for the return trip to Vale.{3}Travel well, {17}{5}.{2}
The road to the lighthouse{3}is in terrible shape after{3}the earthquake...{1}I've got no clue how {17}{5}{3}and the others made it back{3}to town on that road.{2}
The elders were saying that{3}the lighthouse beacon is tough{3}to put out once it's lit.{2}
On the other hand, now that{3}Alchemy is free, maybe I{3}should study Alchemy...{2}
Maybe if I train hard enough,{3}I'll be as strong as Menardi{3}and Karst were...{2}
If the light of the beacon{3}keeps shining, the power{3}of Alchemy will never end...{1}Even if Prox is attacked,{3}the bright flames of our{3}strength will burn on.{2}
When {17}{5} left Prox, I didn't{3}think much of him, but now,{3}he's totally hot!{2}
What took you so long?{3}Mom and Dad are tired{3}of waiting for you...{2}
That's not true, {17}{5}. You take{3}as long as you need to say{3}farewell to the people of Prox.{2}
Don't worry about us, {17}{5}...{3}Puelle and the others took{3}good care of us.{2}
Don't tell him that! We'll be{3}stuck here forever!{2}
You look like you're feeling back{3}to your old self, {17}{6}!{2}
You were weeping such{3}mournful tears after the battle...{2}
What!? As if!{3}You can't prove anything!{2}
Go easy on her. You have to{3}remember, she thought that{3}both of her parents had died.{2}
Oh, were you crying, {17}{6}?{2}
No! I said...{3}I said I wasn't!{2}
Now you've got me thinking{3}about my family... I didn't think{3}I'd miss them this much...{2}
I only hope that they're all{3}safe back in Vale...{2}
I just want to be home again...{3}I want to see how my mother{3}is doing...{2}
Don't worry, Son. I'm sure{3}Dora's doing fine. She's a{3}strong woman.{2}
But last time I saw her, she{3}looked so sick, so weak...{1}Even if nothing happened{3}to Vale, I'm still worried...{2}
Don't worry, {17}{1}. I'm sure{3}she's in wonderful shape.{1}I think she'll be surprised{3}to see me!{2}
And she wouldn't let anything{3}happen until you came home.{2}
Sorry to keep you all waiting.{3}At last, the time has come for{3}us to return to Vale...{2}
As soon as we leave Prox,{3}we'll head toward Angara, and{3}from there, to Vale...{2}
I can't wait to see this{3}winged ship of yours! It{3}sounds so incredible!{2}
I remember so little of our{3}trip to Prox... This is really{3}my first voyage on a ship.{2}
I've heard that the wind and{3}waves make the boat rock...{3}I hope I don't get sick...{2}
This ancient ship of ours{3}actually flies above the{3}ocean... It's quite a cozy ride.{2}
It looks like we've got{3}an exciting last trip{3}ahead of us, doesn't it?{30}
Wow... Setting out like this{3}takes me back to our own{3}quest's start... It was so long ago.{2}
I'm still worried about my{3}mother, but I'll try to put it{3}aside and enjoy the trip.{2}
If you keep talking like this,{3}we'll never go anywhere!{3}Let's go, {17}{5}!{2}
What's the matter, boys?{3}Are you reluctant to depart?{30}
It's hard to believe that our{3}quest is almost at its end.{3}I know how you feel.{2}
After all that we've been{3}through, you can't possibly be{3}nervous about this small trip!{2}
I just hope that Vale came out{3}of this in as good a condition{3}as Prox did...{2}
We won't know until we get there.{2}
I can't stop thinking about{3}how my parents are doing...{2}
Were the both of them in Vale?{2}
Can't you make a guess, Kraden?{3}Will Vale still be standing{3}when we arrive?{2}
Not even I can know that...{2}
I can see it in your eyes,{3}Kraden! You think something's{3}happened, don't you?{2}
It's a possibility... One that{3}cannot be ignored...{2}
If it's not there, then what's{3}the point in even going back?{2}
Is that really how you{3}feel, {17}{1}? What about{3}you, {17}{5}?{30}
Have you already forgotten all{3}that we discussed? You ought{3}to refresh your memory!{2}
You remember, don't you,{3}{17}{5}? Think about it{3}for a moment, {17}{1}.{2}
What do you mean?{2}
Our conversation with Hamma{3}after we ignited the beacon...{2}
Don't you remember us talking{3}to the children from Imil at the{3}base of Mercury Lighthouse?{2}
When they were warning people{3}away from the lighthouses?{2}
Yes. The Wise One instructed{3}everyone to seek refuge.{2}
Yeah, so what about it?{2}
You still don't see, {17}{2}?{2}
Even if Vale were destroyed,{3}I'd expect that the villagers{3}have all escaped to safety.{2}
I guess that's true... They{3}might still be all right.{2}
That's true... So whatever{3}happens, my family's alive!{2}
I'd forgotten about that...{3}Thanks, Kraden.{2}
{17}{2}, can you make sure{3}everyone else knows that?{2}
OK, let's go. The both of you!{3}We have to catch up to{3}everyone.{2}
Kraden...{2}
Why did the Wise One change{3}our parents into a dragon? Why{3}did he make us fight them?{2}
I mean, we almost killed them...{3}He tried to make us kill our{3}own parents. Why?{2}
Do you think that he intended{3}for them to die from the start?{30}
I cannot speak for him, but I{3}think he knew that they would{3}be revived by the beacon's light.{2}
Ah... You don't understand why{3}he put you through all this if{3}he knew they'd survive...{2}
We cannot hope to fathom the{3}motives of a being as all-{3}powerful as the Wise One...{2}
You don't know either, Kraden?{2}
I can only hazard a guess...{3}The Wise One...{3}wanted to test you.{2}
What do you mean, test us?{2}
I cannot tell you more... It is{3}up to you to find the answer.{2}
Will we use Alchemy to wage{3}war, to raise armies?{1}Or will we use it to grow wise,{3}to rise above our petty feuds{3}and perform great deeds?{2}
You were willing to sacrifice{3}everything for your quest. I'd say{3}you've risen to this challenge.{2}
Oops! Is everyone else that{3}far ahead of us?{2}
We'd better hurry and catch{3}up to the others before they{3}leave us behind!{2}
After all, I'm not terribly{3}interested in trying to walk{3}all the way back to Vale.{2}
If you feel the same, then{3}we'd better be hurrying.{2}
{17}{1}! {17}{5}!{3}We're off!{2}
Kraden, come look at this...{3}There's a huge ice wall{3}blocking our path...{2}
Hm... If we can't do something{3}about that wall, we're not going{3}any farther, {17}{5}.{2}
Kraden, come look at this...{3}There's a huge ice wall{3}blocking our path...{2}
Nothing to worry about,{3}{17}{6}. We'll just have to{3}use that cannon we got in Loho!{2}
That's right! If the cannon can{3}blast away a stone wall, think{3}what it'll do to ice!{2}
{17}{5}, take us between those{3}two blocks of ice for shelter{3}when you fire the cannon.{2}
We should be safe if we{3}fire from this distance.{2}
OK, here we go! {17}{5}, aim{3}right at the ice wall and fire{3}when ready!{30}
What? You're not ready yet?{3}Take your time and get{3}into position then...{1}But as soon as you're{3}ready, fire!{2}
Fire the Magma Ball!{2}
Great! We did it! We{3}can keep going now!{2}
All right, let's head for{3}the Northern Seas.{2}
Let's go!{2}
The Golden Sun... The very{3}quintessence of Alchemy's{3}power! It's beginning!{2}
Wait for me! Please, wait!{3}Wait until I reach the{3}summit of Mt. Aleph!{2}
At last! I have it!{3}Eternal life...and{3}limitless power!{2}
At last, the power of nature{3}is mine to control as I will!{2}
Rise, storms! Rise up and{3}unleash your might upon Vale{3}and the foothills of Mt. Aleph!{2}
That's odd... I should have{3}limitless power... So why can't{3}I call up a simple storm?{2}
Wh-Who are you?{2}
I am called the Wise One...{2}
The Wise One? Vale's protector?{2}
You wish to have limitless power?{2}
Wish to?{3}I just got it!{2}
No. Your power is nearly{3}limitless, but it has boundaries.{2}
Nearly limitless? You speak{3}in riddles. Can't you see?{3}The power is mine!{2}
Yes. You also have nearly endless{3}life. And your Psynergy is...{3}somewhat stronger.{2}
If you are trying to anger me,{3}have a little taste of exactly how{3}much power I have attained!{2}
Look at me! My body is{3}brimming with power!{2}
How!? What's going on?{3}I should be all-powerful!{3}How can you defeat me?!?{2}
You are not all-powerful, Alex.{3}Your power has its limits, as{3}does your life.{2}
That cannot be! Who is{3}responsible for this treachery?{3}Who has robbed me of my dream?{2}
I, the Wise One, imbued the Mars{3}Star with some of the power{3}of the forming Golden Sun.{1}It rests even now in the hands{3}of young {17}{1}.{2}
Why?{2}
The heavens and earth are{3}changing, Alex! You must{3}flee{5} now!{2}
Wha-What!?{2}
Mt. Aleph will soon be drawn{3}into the heart of the earth! You{3}must flee or join it forever!{2}
Flee?! I can't flee!{5}{3}I can't even move!{2}
Ah, yes. You now see the limits of{3}your power. If you are swallowed{3}by the earth, you may not survive.{2}
If you survive, perhaps we{3}shall meet again someday...{2}
We're heading to Tolbi. We hear{3}there's a tournament there{3}called Colosso.{1}I'm Morgan, and this here's{3}Dekka. We're gonna compete,{3}and we're gonna win!{2}
Hey, if you see a gladiator{3}named {17}{1}, give him{3}a message for me...{1}If he's thinking about going{3}to Colosso this year, he doesn't{3}stand a chance of winning!{2}
The gladiator who takes the{3}prize in Colosso earns quite{3}a reputation as a warrior...{1}Mercenaries get a lot more{3}jobs when they've got a{3}good reputation.{2}
We fought in Colosso last{3}year, but we lost to a weaselly{3}little kid named {17}{1}.{1}We're after revenge, so we've{3}been out on a risky journey to{3}increase our fighting strength.{2}
I found {17}{1}!{2}
We've been looking for{3}you, {17}{1}!{2}
Who are you guys?{2}
The name's Satrage. You{3}took me out in the last{3}round at Colosso.{2}
And I'm Azart!{2}
And don't forget Navampa!{2}
Oh. It's you guys.{2}
Is that any way to say{3}hello to some old friends?{2}
What's your problem?{2}
We want to talk to you{3}about your fighting style{3}at Colosso.{2}
Yeah. And we think you shouldn't{3}have won, {17}{1}. We think{3}you didn't fight fair.{2}
It sounds like you resent the{3}fact that {17}{1} beat you...{2}
We've just been thinking about{3}it, and there's no way that{3}{17}{1} should have won!{2}
Right. So you think I cheated{3}just because I used my{3}Pynergy abilities in Colosso?{2}
I don't know how you did{3}it. I'm just sayin' I think{3}you cheated is all...{2}
Ah, but Psynergy is a warrior's{3}skill, every bit as much as your{3}sword arts. It isn't cheating.{2}
You're not listening, are you,{3}old man? That fight was fixed,{3}and we're here to pay you back!{2}
Hey, these guys aren't{3}very strong at all!{2}
Ha! We were right! They{3}{9}{2}were{7} cheating at Colosso!{30}
I knew it!{2}
It takes a lot to reach the{3}finals at Colosso... A lot more{3}than you guys can take.{2}
You look like you've got{3}business in here, but there's{3}no way you're getting past us.{2}
Give it up! We're staying here.{3}We've got our eyes peeled, and{3}there's no way you're getting in!{2}
These guys were phenomenal!{2}
Which one of you didn't think{3}they won Colosso fair and{3}square?{2}
It wasn't me! I think both you{3}and Navampa were saying{3}something like that.{2}
So. You don't still think our{3}victory at Colosso was fixed,{3}do you?{2}
No way, {17}{1}! We've seen{3}the error of our ways!{2}
We promise we won't badmouth{3}you or call you a fraud ever{3}again. Will you forgive us?{30}
Don't be that way! We've{3}learned our lesson! Forgive us!{30}
You're not such a bad{3}kid after all!{2}
You came out here looking{3}for treasure, didn't you?{2}
Here, this was in the chest{3}we found.{2}
You were nice enough to{3}forgive us, so we think you{3}should have it.{2}
Right, well... I guess we'll{3}be leaving now.{2}
By the time the next Colosso{3}rolls around, we ought to be{3}strong enough to win for sure!{2}
Maybe we'll see you there.{2}
{17}{1}!{2}
{17}{1}, is it you? Do my{3}eyes deceive me?{30}
Oh. I must have been mistaken.{2}
No, you are not{3}{17}{1}, are you?{2}
Young lady, are you looking{3}for someone by the name{3}of {17}{1}?{2}
Yes, old man! I am looking{3}for one called {17}{1}!{2}
Where is {17}{1}?{2}
I'm sorry... {17}{1} isn't{3}with us...{2}
Well then, where can I{3}find {17}{1}?{2}
Why do you want to find{3}him so badly?{2}
Me? I am Feizhi... {17}{1}{3}helped me once.{2}
He helped Ulmuch. Ulmuch was{3}trapped, but {17}{1} saved him.{3}He is a brave man, isn't he?{2}
I suppose... But why are you{3}looking for him? Do you{5}{3}like him? Is that it?{2}
You're a mean old man. It is{3}not polite to tease me.{2}
That's what it is! You{3}like {17}{1}!{2}
No! I am so embarrassed!{2}
Don't worry, Feizhi... We'll tell{3}{17}{1} how you feel!{2}
I...{5} Really?{2}
Then...will you give him{3}this when you tell him?{2}
What is it?{2}
{17}{1} is on a dangerous{3}journey. I am worried about him,{3}so I made him a good luck charm.{2}
Ah, a good luck charm... I see.{2}
I am going home now, old man.{3}Thank you for doing this favor{3}for me.{2}
Legends said that Crossbone{3}Isle could be found in the{3}middle of the Karagol Sea.{2}
Ah... Crossbone Isle... Wait,{3}did you say "could"? Is it not{3}there anymore or something?{2}
Well, it's still there, but there's{3}no point in going. Someone{3}named {17}{1} picked it clean.{2}
What, he took all the treasure?{2}
Yeah. And apparently, he{3}even defeated the ancient{3}ghost pirate protecting it...{2}
What about the stories that if you{3}beat the ghost pirate, you would{3}become the leader of all pirates?{2}
Well, you see, that means that{3}{17}{1} is our leader now.{2}
Wow... just like that?{5} I'll bet{3}he's pretty tough.{2}
No doubt. But you know, he{3}must be a reliable guy, too...{2}
You think?{2}
You'd have to be to beat that{3}ghost. That's why we're looking{3}for him now, remember?{2}
If he's looking for a pirate{3}crew, he can count me in!{2}
Hey! Wait a minute!{2}
Who are you?{2}
You were talking about{3}{17}{1}, weren't you?{2}
Don't play dumb...{3}We all heard you.{2}
Yes, we know {17}{1}.{3}What about him?{2}
Well, why don't you tell us{3}where we can find him?{2}
Why should we tell{3}you anything?{2}
{17}{1} took good care of{3}us when we were in Vault, and{3}we'd like to thank him...{2}
Ah, yes... Well... I'm afraid{3}we don't know where you can{3}find {17}{1} right now.{2}
Oh, is that so? Well, I guess{3}we'll just have to give you the{3}reward we'd planned for him.{2}
You've got a grudge against{3}{17}{1}, and you're going{3}to take it out on us?{2}
Oh yeah, you could call it{3}a grudge... A serious grudge.{2}
But don't worry... We're just{3}going to give you a little sample{3}of what we've planned for him.{2}
It looks like {17}{1} runs{3}with a pretty feeble crowd...{2}
Well, we have been working out.{3}Maybe {17}{1} won't be so{3}tough this time around...{2}
So you think we just{3}got a lot stronger?{2}
You let {17}{1} know{3}we're looking for him!{2}
The band of thieves he busted{3}in Vault are coming to repay{3}the favor!{2}
And we're not messing around!{2}
Be sure you tell him!{3}And send him this way!{2}
We lost again...{2}
So, boss... You, uh... You think{3}maybe it was a mistake going{3}after these guys?{2}
This means we're going to{3}jail again, doesn't it?{2}
Aw... Why do we have to go{3}back to jail. I hate it there...{2}
It's not like we really hurt{3}anyone... After all, we lost!{2}
Yeah... And it's not like we{3}stole anything...this time...{2}
We're not gonna have to{3}go to jail, are we?{2}
You're thieves!{2}
If we asked around, we could{3}probably find a dozen reasons{3}to have you locked up!{2}
Are you guys, like, wandering{3}sheriffs or something?{30}
Because we could be really{3}useful to you if you are. We know{3}all sorts of criminal elements...{2}
And even if you're not, we{3}could be really useful to you...{3}Anything's better than jail!{2}
You can't honestly believe{3}we would let you join us!{2}
Hey, come on! We haven't done{3}anything wrong, really! Not yet,{3}anyway...{2}
Yeah! We didn't have enough{3}time to do anything bad before{3}we ran into you guys!{2}
Yeah, so give us a break!{2}
So, uh... Bye! See you later!{2}
Will you promise to stop{3}following {17}{1} and trying{3}to get revenge on him?{2}
The four elements are{3}the basic building{3}blocks of all matter.{1}The elemental spirits{3}are called Djinn.{1}The four elements are{3}Venus for Earth,{3}Mercury for Water,{1}Mars for Fire, and{3}Jupiter for Wind.{1}Each element has many{3}different Djinn.
When you set a Djinni, its{3}elemental power may{3}change your class{1}or Psynergy. In battle,{3}you can unleash the{3}powers of set Djinn.
When a Djinni is standing{3}by, you can use it{3}to summon in battle.{1}To use a summon{3}immediately, put your{3}Djinn on standby before{1}battle. But be careful,{3}because changing set{3}Djinn to standby changes{1}your class and Psynergy.
If you have a standby{3}Djinni in battle, you{3}can use it to summon.{1}After summoning, the{3}Djinni will be in{3}recovery until it has{1}recovered all its{3}power. Recovering Djinni{3}cannot be unleashed{1}or used to summon.
If a Djinni's power is{3}used to summon, the{3}Djinni enters recovery.{1}After it has recovered{3}its power, it will set{3}itself once again.
When a Djinni is set to{3}an Adept, its power{3}may change the Adept's{1}class. Find your own{3}unique combinations of{3}Djinni to improve your{1}characters' classes.
Psynergy is a mental{3}power. People who wield{3}it are called Adepts.{1}Psynergy can change{3}with class changes or{3}when you go up a level.{1}Try changing your{3}class to earn new{3}Psynergy.
To give your Djinni to{3}someone else, move it{3}like this.{2}
After choosing who gets the{3}Djinni, you can "set" it.{2}
When your class changes,{3}the Psynergy you can use{3}may also change.{2}
Setting a Djinni changes your{3}attributes and sometimes{3}even your class.{2}
Each Djinni has different,{3}unique powers.{30}
Once we have been set, you{3}can unleash us in battle to{3}use our powers.{30}
So, {16}, let me demonstrate{3}the power of my attack now.{30}
See! What did I tell you? When{3}you unleashed me, I used my{3}special attack ability!{2}
After being unleashed, we{3}Djinn will then stand by, ready{3}to be summoned back again...{30}
If you have multiple standby{3}Djinn, you can summon even{3}greater powers into battle!{30}
Choose this command when{3}you want to unleash me in{3}battle, all right?{30}
Then you can summon{3}even greater powers!{30}
After a Djinni has been{3}used to summon, it must{3}spend time in recovery.{2}
And once we've recovered,{3}we automatically set ourselves{3}again, so we're ready to attack!{2}
That's all you have to do{3}to unleash a set Djinni!{2}
Hey!{2}
You look like you already{3}know a little about us, huh?{30}
Well, you weren't very surprised{3}when you saw me. Am I right?{30}
No way! You? Surprised?{3}Nah, I can't believe that!{1}I mean, look at you! You're{3}an Adept!{2}
I thought so. I could tell{3}you were an Adept from{3}a mile away!{2}
See, you know all about us,{3}so you must be an Adept.{2}
Even I know that!{2}
You look like you're new around{3}here. Embarking on a dangerous{3}journey in a strange land?{2}
I thought so... Well, I'm looking{3}for my companions... We were{3}parted when Mt. Aleph erupted.{2}
Would you mind helping{3}me find my companions?{2}
Come on, take me with{3}you. I'll even lend you and{3}your allies my powers!{2}
You see, the more Djinn you{3}have with you, the more powerful{3}your Psynergy becomes!{2}
All you have to do is set us{3}and then unleash us in battle!{2}
If you gather a bunch of us,{3}you'll have all that power{3}at your disposal!{2}
So what do you say? Will{3}you be a pal and take me{3}with you?{30}
Oh, come on! I promise I won't{3}be a burden and eat all your{3}chips or anything!{30}
But if I'm with you, you'll{3}be all kinds of strong!{30}
Wait, that's not it... There's{3}more! Your allies will develop{3}{9}{4}exciting new abilities{7}!{30}
And I'll be your best friend ever{3}in combat! I'll be all over the{3}bad guys, I promise!{30}
What, you want to see me{3}beg? Fine! I'm begging! PLEASE!{3}Let me join your group!{30}
You just don't get it, do you?{3}I'm not used to being ignored,{3}you know. Take me with you!{30}
Don't be a meanie, OK? Nobody{3}likes a meanie. I'm serious{3}here.{1}You don't really want to{3}leave me behind, do you?{30}
Oh, all right. If that's the way{3}you're gonna be, fine.{5}{5}{3}I'm coming with you anyway!{2}
I'm so happy! Oh, you won't{3}regret this, I promise!{2}
The Venus Djinni {8}{5}{21}{8}{16}{3}has become {16}'s pal.{2}
While I'm here, would you like{3}me to give you a quick{3}explanation about Djinn?{30}
After bringing a Djinni{3}into your party, you must{3}set it to somebody.{2}
Next, I'll show you how you{3}can use us in battle.{2}
See! We Djinn can be{3}pretty useful, can't we?{2}
But...there's one more thing.{2}
So, we go from set{3}to standby to recovery,{3}then back to set.{2}
That's just a simple little{3}explanation of how to use us.{2}
Did you get all that?{30}
Hmmmm...{5} Do you want me to{3}explain it all to you again?{30}
Well, then, I guess I'll go back{3}to the beginning, OK?{2}
Well, that's it. Now, we're{3}pals forever!{2}
Oh, yeah! If you want to{3}learn more about Djinn,{3}refer to the help, OK?{2}
You and your friends should{3}make sure you get the most{3}out of us Djinn.{2}
To give your Djinni to{3}someone else, move it{3}like this.{2}
After choosing who gets the{3}Djinni, you can "set" it.{2}
When your class changes,{3}the Psynergy you can use{3}may also change.{2}

Well, you didn't look surprised{3}when you saw me. Were you?{30}
No way! You? Surprised?{3}Nah, I can't believe that!{1}I mean, look at you! You're{3}an Adept!{2}
I thought so. I could tell{3}you were an Adept from{3}a mile away!{2}

You and your friends should{3}make sure you get the most{3}out of us Djinn.{2}
It looks like seawater has{3}seeped into the well.{1}I doubt anyone will be using{3}it for quite a while.{2}
There's a passageway at{3}the bottom of the well!{1}I wonder if anyone else{3}knows about this...{2}
It's completely full of water.{3}The bottom is really deep.{2}
Meh? I saw the silhouette{3}of a man in the well!{2}
It looks like this well doesn't{3}get a lot of use.{1}I guess it's because it's so far{3}from the main part of town.{2}
There's only a little bit of water{3}down at the bottom of the well.{1}As hot as it gets around here,{3}I bet the water evaporates fast.{2}
This well looks really old.{1}I'll bet this is exactly how it{3}looked back in ancient times.{2}
There are some potatoes{3}boiling in the pot.{1}Maybe they're making{3}potato salad.{2}
They're making nan.{1}It looks weird, though...{3}I guess in Madra, they add{3}nuts and raisins.{2}
All the spices are neatly{3}arranged.{1}No dining table in Madra would{3}be complete without them.{2}
There's a chicken curry slowly{3}simmering on the stove.{1}Judging from the smell and{3}the deep red color, it must{3}have a lot of tomatoes in it.{2}
A pot of Masala tea is{3}boiling on the stove.{1}It's full of milk, and it{3}has a nice, sweet smell.{3}It's driving me crazy!{2}
They're making tandoori chicken.{1}In Madra, it's cooked on the{3}bone. It's one of the dishes{3}they're famous for.{2}
It's a roast chicken so big{3}that it's practically bursting{3}out of the oven!{1}Hmm... I wonder if it was{3}related to the chicken I saw{3}outside... I thought it was a pet!{2}
Fresh eggs, over easy...{3}Some people call 'em{3}"sunny side up"!{1}When it comes to breakfast,{3}these are the best!{2}
That cheese looks fabulous.{1}I could really use a snack...{3}Maybe with some bread and{176}{3}Gah! I'm getting hungry!{2}
Eeeeew!{3}They're frying up bug larvae!!{1}It looks awful!{3}But it smells GREAT!{2}
It's lamb on the bone, broiled{3}over an open flame. The lamb is{3}golden brown and juicy.{1}They'd probably notice if{3}I took some... Too bad.{2}
Huh, what is that!?{3}Lobster grilled in the shell!{1}I'd like to experience this{3}luxurious culinary treat{3}at least once in my life!{2}
Newts skewered over an{3}open flame.{1}Are they making food or some{3}strange kind of medicine?{2}
There are lots of strange-{3}looking plants boiling in that{3}large pot.{1}It's got a familiar smell I just{3}can't quite put my finger on.{2}
Seasonal veggies boiling{3}with some lamb meat.{1}The oyster seasoning is{3}really tempting my tummy.{2} 
There is a seafood pie baking{3}in the oven.{1}Its reputation for having a, er,{3}fragrant smell precedes it.{2}
It looks like some kind{3}of seafood soup.{1}It smells like the ocean!{2}
It's Alhafra's famous{3}broiled lobster!{1}It's bigger than I could ever{3}possibly have imagined!{2}
That seafood stew has an{3}abundant variety of fish.{1}One bite of that, and I'd{3}be hooked!{2}
The steel resting in the flames{3}is glowing bright red.{1}This must be where they{3}forge sharp items.{2}
There's fish I've never seen{3}before gently simmering there.{1}I wonder what this foul soup{3}could possibly taste like...{3}I'm not sure I want to find out.{2}
There's a bright-red soup{3}full of beans and tomatoes{3}simmering.{1}That spicy smell is really{3}something else, but it might{3}burn my mouth a bit.{2}
Ah, the smell of fresh corn{3}bread cooking in the oven!{1}One whiff, and I'm drooling{3}like a bulldog!{2}
Contigo's famous for these{3}cookies they make...{1}I've heard that, even if you{3}have the recipe, it still takes{3}years to learn to bake them.{2}
It's roasted fish from{3}the nearby river.{1}The smoke is getting in my eyes.{2}
That simmering soup is{3}made with broth of cow bones.{1}It seems it's a traditional{3}Shaman meal, passed down{3}from generation to generation.{2}
I've never seen vegetables{3}like the ones boiling there.{1}Whoa! They really stink!{3}Do people actually eat those!?{2}
There's Kaltic stew made with{3}lamb meat and potatoes.{1}Looks pretty tasty, if you{3}like boiled meat.{2}
Those boiling vegetables{3}look like weeds.{1}I'm pretty sure I won't{3}be eating any of those{3}anytime soon.{2}
There's cheese in this stew.{1}Hey! There's mold growing on it!{3}Is it supposed to be like that?{2}
There is some strange{3}dish made using fish eggs.{1}There are strings coming from{3}them. I wonder if that's normal.{2}
They've got some strange{3}meat I've never seen before.{1}Instead of using firewood,{3}they're cooking it with burning{3}antlers.{1}I wonder if the meat{3}and the antlers came{3}from the same animal.{2}
It looks like there's a captain's{3}logbook in here.{1}There's something about an{3}unreported trip to Lemuria in{3}here... I guess they were rushed.{2}  
There's a book called "The{3}Great Adventures of Lunpa."{3}...Written by Lunpa, no less.{1}"When the great flood came,{3}we fled our homes by boat.{3}Waves engulfed our ships.{1}"We came to in a strange{3}land called Lemuria."{2}
I found a letter from Babi.{3}On the outside, it reads,{3}"To my dear friend Lunpa."{1}Babi wrote, "Forgive me,{3}Lunpa, but I must leave the{3}island without you."{2} 
Here's a book called{3}"The History of Lemuria."{1}An excerpt: "Only traces of{3}the once-brilliant land of{3}Lemuria remain today."{2}
Here's a book called{3}"Elemental Lighthouses."{1}It reads, "The beacons of the{3}four elemental lighthouses{3}brighten the fringes of Weyard."{2}
Here's a book called "The{3}Great Lemurian People."{1}"The chosen master of{3}water will be a native{3}son of Lemuria." {2}
Here's a book called{3}"Alchemy and Ancient{3}Civilization: Part I."{1}"Through the use of Alchemy,{3}civilization undergoes great{3}growth and improvement."{2}
Here's a book called{3}"Alchemy and Ancient{3}Civilization: Part II."{1}"Those who master Alchemy{3}shall master the world." {2}
Here's a book called{3}"The Diary of Hydros."{1}"{17}{8} is most{3}definitely still alive. I pray{3}for his safe return."{2}
It's pleasantly cool.{2}
What in{176}!!! {15}{4}{15}{4}{1}{12}{11}What's with all these bathrobes?!?{3}Where are the baths?{2}
Finally! We've reached Vale.{2}
... ...{2}
What's the matter, {17}{2}?{3}You're finally home again.{3}Aren't you happy?{2}
{17}{2}'s just worried{3}about what's happened{3}to everyone in Vale.{2}
So it's just over{3}that last hill?{2}
I can't wait to see what{3}your hometown looks like.{2}
It's beautiful... I'm sure you{3}will like it, {17}{8}.{2}
I'm...just going to close my{3}eyes. Someone tell me if{3}it's all right to open them.{2}
Me too... Would someone{3}else see how things are?{2}
I'll go. Come with{3}me, {17}{5}.{2}
How's it look, {17}{1}?{2}
I'm almost there...{2}
It... It can't be...{2}
What is it, {17}{1}?{3}...{17}{5}? Say something!{2}
I'm sorry, {17}{6}, but...{3}Vale...Mt. Aleph...{3}They're gone!{2}
What!?{2}
This... This is terrible.{2}
Is that Mt. Aleph?{2}
Mom...{2}
Dora...{2}
Mom... Dad...{2}
{17}{1}... {17}{2}...{3}What can I do? What can{3}I say to comfort you?{2}
They're here somewhere...{3}They have to be here...{2}
What can we do? How{3}can we help them now?{2}
I don't know... Call out to{3}them... Such a tragedy...{2}
I'll call them...{2}
{17}{1}...{3}{17}{2}...{2}
I understand what you're{3}feeling. I've felt it, too.{2}
But standing here won't{3}bring them back.{2}
Let's go back to Vault. We{3}can rest there and think...{2}
